.. Port 137 UDP - The Name Service runs on UDP port 137 - Client sends 16 Byte name and in B mode it's broadcast and the ip address is replied.
In P mode it's sent to an NBNS server.

NetBIOS Datagram service.

.. Port 138 UDP The Datagram Distribution Service is the NBT service that handles NetBIOS datagram transport.
It runs on UDP port 138, and can handle unicast (also known as "specific"), multicast (group), and broadcast NetBIOS datagrams.

NetBIOS session service.

.. Port 139 is the session servide. Used by smb.

Changed port numbers so can run on local host

RTSMB_NBSS_DIRECT_PORT        Is not supported on the server, only client, needs to be fixed.

RTSMB_NBSS_DIRECT_PORT        Is not supported on the server, only client, needs to be fixed.
    Added support to server moudule temorarily by enabling only 445.
Todo
    Need to offer both 445 and 139, not just a compile time flag

Fixed - SR_GetTreeId, Was failing on IPC

Todo
    Playwith IPC now that they function

Todo Identify connect sequence server
ProcNegotiateProtocol calls
        WRITE_SMB (srv_cmd_fill_negotiate_nt);

        srv_cmd_fill_negotiate_nt - Is in srvans
            We need srvans V2 to write out the V2 header
        On an SMBNT
        For V2 we need
            WRITE_SMB (srv_cmd_fill_negotiate_v2);
Todo Identify connect sequence client
        rtsmb_cli_session_send_negotiate - needs to send V2 dialect string
        rtsmb_cli_session_receive_negotiate - needs to process response

        See pg 22 of spec for alias strings- Support SMB 2.002 initially SMB2 NEGOTIATE Response
        See pg 39 of spec for alias strings- Support SMB2 NEGOTIATE Response format

Test ebs client to serve using port 139 for session.

Notes:

    About log on -

        smbv2 security blob get sent with connection rtsmb_cli_session_new_with_ip
        for V2 log in we need:
            Blob extracted from rtsmb_cli_session_logon_user

         [MS-AUTHSOD] section 2.1.2.2.
