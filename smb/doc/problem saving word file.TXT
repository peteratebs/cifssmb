You folks do awesome work! :-)  Thanks a lot for the fix.

		Ryan,

			Do a CVS update and re-make. It should work
		now (it does here and I was able to reproduce your
		bug). The problem was once you start telling NT you
		do NT SMB calls it expects to be able to send a
		trans2::SMB_SET_FILE_ALLOCATION_INFO (and also a set
		delete attribute) successfully - we were returning
		"not implemented".

		Thanks for the logfile - I couldn't have fixed it
		without it.

		I will do the delete attribute code soon (not a problem
		for MS Office though).

		Cheers,
