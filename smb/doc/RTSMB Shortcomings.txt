
* Commands not supported:
These because we don't support byte range locking:
LOCK_BYTE_RANGE
UNLOCK_BYTE_RANGE
WRITE_AND_UNLOCK
LOCK_AND_READ

These because we don't do connection-less transports (that is, we use TCP/IP):
READ_MPX
WRITE_MPX
READ_MPX_SECONDARY
TRANSACTION_SECONDARY
TRANSACTION2_SECONDARY
NT_TRANSACT_SECONDARY

The following command isn't supported both because it is optional and because our printing is simplistic enough not to need it:
SMB_COM_GET_PRINT_QUEUE

These because they imply a lot of functionality that just doesn't exist outside of NT, like NT security, QOS, and extended file attributes:
NT_TRANSACT_CREATE


* Features not supported:
Extended file attributes (not all file systems support it)
Large files (64-bit offsets -- mostly there.  just a little glue code for file systems)
Opportunistic locks (oplocks -- its an efficiency thing)
Byte range locking (locking pieces of files so that other clients/processes don't use them)
Sharing mode (locking whole files so that other clients/processes don't use them)
Extended security (using security blobs and such)
Remote authorization using a primary domain controller (some code for this is in there, but it isn't complete)
Multihomed brower service
