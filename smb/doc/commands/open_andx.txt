 Server Response                    Description
 ================================== =================================

DesiredAccess describes the access the client desires for the file (see
section 3.6 -  Access Mode Encoding).

OpenFunction specifies the action to be taken depending on whether or
not the file exists (see section 3.8 -  Open Function Encoding).  Action
in the response specifies the action as a result of the Open request
(see section 3.9 -  Open Action Encoding).

SearchAttributes indicates the attributes that the file must have to be
found while searching to see if it exists.  The encoding of this field
is described in the "File Attribute Encoding" section elsewhere in this
document.  If SearchAttributes is zero then only normal files are
returned.  If the system file, hidden or directory attributes are
specified then the search is inclusive -- both the specified type(s) of
files and normal files are returned.

FileType returns the kind of resource actually opened:


 Name                       Value  Description
 ========================== ====== ==================================

 FileTypeDisk               0      Disk file or directory as defined
                                    in the attribute field
 FileTypeByteModePipe       1      Named pipe in byte mode
 FileTypeMessageModePipe    2      Named pipe in message mode
 FileTypePrinter            3      Spooled printer
 FileTypeUnknown            0xFFFF Unrecognized resource type



If bit0 of Flags is clear, the FileAttributes, LastWriteTime, DataSize,
FileType, and DeviceState have indeterminate values in the response.

This SMB can request an oplock on the opened file.  Oplocks are fully
described in the "Oplocks" section elsewhere in this document, and there
is also discussion of oplocks in the SMB_COM_LOCKING_ANDX SMB
description.  Bit1 and bit2 of the Flags field are used to request
oplocks during open.

The following SMBs may follow SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX:


   SMB_COM_READ    SMB_COM_READ_ANDX
   SMB_COM_IOCTL
