Memory requirement
Each smbd process will need approximately 1 MB of memory. Using
a very large smb.conf file can significantly increase memory
utilization above this minimum. Therefore, it is good practice to
minimize unnecessary lines in the smb.conf file. One way to achieve
this is to use the SWAT utility for configuration. For 2048 clients, the
system should have at least 2 GB of physical memory. This is over
and above the requirements of other applications that will be
running concurrently with CIFS.

I'm sticking samba into an embedded system, and disk space is at a
premium.  I noticed that the many of the same object files that are
being compiled into libsmbclient.so are also being compiled into
many other targets.  As an experiment, I created the following patch,
which dynamically links most targets to libsambaclient.so instead of
statically linking the common objects.

The result worked beautifully, so I'm including my patch here in case
it might help someone with a similar goal.  To use it, apply the
patch, then run autoconf.  You might need to upgrade your autoconf,
since samba-3.0.0 requires a relatively recent one.

I'm also invoking configure thusly:

CFLAGS="-Os" ./configure --disable-cups --with-libsmbclient --with-privatedir=/tmp --with-lockdir=/var/locks --with-piddir=/var/locks --with-configdir=/etc --with-logfilebase=/var/log --without-ldap --without-utmp --without-python --with-smbmount --with-libiconv=/home/dave/C/perforce/source/deschutes/rootfs/ati-nfsroot --disable-debug --disable-developer --disable-krb5developer

Here are the programs I use with their new, smaller sizes:

 198310 nmblookup
 182157 smbclient
  22370 smbmnt
  36838 smbmount
  12379 smbumount
 326827 nmbd
2815766 smbd

This is still about 1.5MB larger than my samba-2.2.8a installation.
I'm looking for any suggestions on how I might make my samba footprint
even smaller.
