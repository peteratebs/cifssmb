Abstract

This document describes the CIFS file sharing protocol, version 1.0.
Client systems use this protocol to request file and print services
from server systems over a network. It is based on the Server Message
Block protocol widely in use by personal computers and workstations
running a wide variety of operating systems.

<a name="s1">1</a>  Introduction

This document describes the file and print sharing protocol for a
proposed Common Internet File System (CIFS). CIFS is intended to provide
an open cross-platform mechanism for client systems to request file and
print services from server systems over a network. It is based on the
standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol widely in use by personal
computers and workstations running a wide variety of operating systems.
An earlier version of this protocol was documented as part of the X/OPEN
(now Open Group) CAE series of standards [7]; this document updates the
specification to include the latest shipping versions, and is published
to allow the creation of implementations that interoperate with those
implementations.

Use of the Internet and the World Wide Web has been characterized by
read-only access. Existing protocols such as FTP are good solutions for
one-way file transfer. However, new read/write interfaces will become
increasingly necessary as the Internet becomes more interactive and
collaborative. Adoption of a common file sharing protocol having modern
semantics such as shared files, byte-range locking, coherent caching,
change notification, replicated storage, etc. would provide important
benefits to the Internet community.


<a name="s1.1">1.1</a>  Summary of features

The protocol supports the following features:

o File access

o File and record locking

o Safe caching, read-ahead, and write-behind

o File change notification

o Protocol version negotiation

o Extended attributes

o Distributed replicated virtual volumes

o Server name resolution independence

o Batched requests

o Unicode file names


<a name="s1.1.1">1.1.1</a>  File access

The protocol supports the usual set of file operations: open, close,
read, write, and seek.



Leach, Naik       expires September, 1997          [Page 5] 


INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


<a name="s1.1.2">1.1.2</a>  File and record locking

The protocol supports file and record locking, as well as unlocked
access to files. Applications that lock files can not be improperly
interfered with by applications that do not; once a file or record is
locked, non-locking applications are denied access to the file.


<a name="s1.1.3">1.1.3</a>  Safe caching, read-ahead, and write-behind

The protocol supports caching, read-ahead, and write-behind, even for
unlocked files, as long as they are safe. All these optimizations are
safe as long as only one client is accessing a file; read-caching and
read-ahead are safe with many clients accessing a file as long as all
are just reading. If many clients are writing a file simultaneously,
then none are safe, and all file operations have to go to the server.
The protocol notifies all clients accessing a file of changes in the
number and access mode of clients accessing the file, so that they can
use the most optimized safe access method.


<a name="s1.1.4">1.1.4</a>  File change notification

Applications can register with a server to be notified if and when file
or directory contents are modified. They can use this to (for example)
know when a display needs to be refreshed, without having to constantly
poll the server.


<a name="s1.1.5">1.1.5</a>  Protocol version negotiation

There are several different versions and sub-versions of this protocol;
a particular version is referred to as a dialect.  When two machines
first come into network contact they negotiate the dialect to be used.
Different dialects can include both new messages as well as changes to
the fields and semantics of existing messages in other dialects.


<a name="s1.1.6">1.1.6</a>  Extended attributes

In addition to many built-in file attributes, such as creation and
modification times, non-file system attributes can be added by
applications, such as the author's name, content description, etc.


<a name="s1.1.7">1.1.7</a>  Distributed replicated virtual volumes

The protocol supports file system subtrees which look like to clients as
if they are on a single volume and server, but which actually span
multiple volumes and servers. The files and directories of such a
subtree can be physically moved to different servers, and their names do
not have to change, isolating clients from changes in the server
configuration. These subtrees can also be transparently replicated for
load sharing and fault tolerance. When a client requests a file, the

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


protocol uses referrals to transparently direct a client to the server
that stores it.


<a name="s1.1.8">1.1.8</a>  Server name resolution independence

The protocol allows clients to resolve server names using any name
resolution mechanism. In particular, it allows using the DNS, permitting
access to the file systems of other organizations over the Internet, or
hierarchical organization of servers' names within an organization.
Earlier versions of the protocol only supported a flat server name
space.


<a name="s1.1.9">1.1.9</a>  Batched requests

The protocol supports the batching of multiple requests into a single
message, in order to minimize round trip latencies, even when a later
request depends on the results of an earlier one.

In order to access a file on a server, a client has to:

o Parse the full file name to determine the server name, and the
  relative name within that server.

o Resolve the server name to a transport address (this may be cached)

o Make a connection to the server (if no connection is already
  available)

o Exchange CIFS messages (see below for an example)

This process may be repeated as many times as desired. Once the
connection has been idle for a while, it may be torn down.


<a name="s2.1">2.1</a>  Server Name Determination

How the client determines the name of the server and the relative name
within the server is outside of the scope of this specification.
However, just for expository purposes, here are three examples.

In the URL "file://fs.megacorp.com/users/fred/stuff.txt", the client
could take the part between the leading double slashes and the next
slash as the server name and the remainder as the relative name -- in
this example "fs.megacorp.com" and "/users/fred/stuff.txt",
respectively.

In the path name "\\corpserver\public\policy.doc" the client could take
the part between the leading double backslashes and the next slash as

the server name, and the remainder as the relative name -- in this
example, "corpserver" and "\public\policy.doc" respectively.

In the path name "x:\policy.doc" the client could use "x" as an index
into a table that contains a server name and a file name prefix. If the
contents of such a table for "x" were "corpserver" and "\public", then
the server name and relative name would be the same as in the previous
example.


<a name="s2.2">2.2</a>  Server Name Resolution

Like server name determination, how the client resolves the name to the
transport address of the server is outside the scope of this
specification. All that is required by CIFS is that a CIFS client MUST
have some means to resolve the name of a CIFS server to a transport
address, and that a CIFS server MUST register its name with a name
resolution service known its clients.

Some examples of name resolution mechanisms include: using the Domain
Name System (DNS) [1,2], and using NETBIOS name resolution (see RFC 1001
and RFC 1002 [3,4]). The server name can also be specified as the string
form of an IPv4 address in the usual dotted decimal notation, e.g.,
"157.33.135.101"; in this case, "resolution" consists of converting to
the 32 bit IPv4 address.

Which method is used is configuration dependent; the default SHOULD be
DNS to encourage interoperability over the Internet.

Note: The name resolution mechanism used may place constraints on the
form of the server name; for example, in the case of NETBIOS, the server
name must be 15 characters or less, and be upper case.


<a name="s2.3">2.3</a>  Sample Message Flow

The following illustrates a typical message exchange sequence for a
client connecting to a user level server, opening a file, reading its
data, closing the file, and disconnecting from the server. Note: using
the CIFS request batching mechanism (called the "AndX" mechanism), the
second to sixth messages in this sequence can be combined into one, so
there are really only three round trips in the sequence, and the last
one can be done asynchronously by the client.

 Client Command             Server Response
 ========================== =========================================

 SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE          Must be the first message sent by client
                            to the server.  Includes a list of SMB
                            dialects supported by the client.  Server
                            response indicates which SMB dialect
                            should be used.
 SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX Transmits the user's name and credentials
                            to the server for verification.
                            Successful server response has Uid field
                            set in SMB header used for subsequent
                            SMBs on behalf of this user.
 SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT       Transmits the name of the disk share the
                            client wants to access.  Successful
                            server response has Tid field set in SMB
                            header used for subsequent SMBs referring
                            to this resource.
 SMB_COM_OPEN               Transmits the name of the file, relative
                            to Tid, the client wants to open.
                            Successful server response includes a
                            file id (Fid) the client should supply
                            for subsequent operations on this file.
 SMB_COM_READ               Client supplies Tid, Fid, file offset,
                            and number of bytes to read.  Successful
                            server response includes the requested
                            file data.
 SMB_COM_CLOSE              Client closes the file represented by Tid
                            and Fid.  Server responds with success
                            code.
 SMB_COM_TREE_DISCONNECT    Client disconnects from resource
                            represented by Tid.


<a name="s2.4">2.4</a>  Message Format

Clients exchange messages with a server to access resources on that
server.  These messages are called Server Message Blocks (SMBs), and
every SMB message has a common format.


<a name="s2.4.1">2.4.1</a>  Notation

This specification makes use of "C"-like notation to describe the
formats of messages. Unlike the "C" language, which allows for
implementation flexibility in laying out structures, this specification
adopts the following rules.  Multi-byte values are always transmitted
least significant byte first. All fields, except "bit-fields", are
aligned on the nearest byte boundary (even if longer than a byte), and
there is no implicit padding. Fields using the "bit field" notation are
defined to be laid out within the structure with the first-named field
occupying the lowest order bits, the next named field the next lowest
order bits, and so on.

<a name="s2.5">2.5</a>  CIFS Protocol Dialect Negotiation

The first message sent from an CIFS client to an CIFS server must be one
whose Command field is SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE.  The format of this client
request includes an array of NULL terminated strings indicating the
dialects of the CIFS protocol which the client supports.  The server
compares this list against the list of dialects the server supports and
returns the index of the chosen dialect in the response message.


<a name="s2.6">2.6</a>  Message Transport

When using a reliable connection oriented transport, the CIFS protocol
makes no higher level attempts to ensure sequenced delivery of messages
between the client and server.  The transport must have some mechanism
to detect failures of either the client or server node, and to deliver
such an indication to the client or server software so they can clean up
state.  When a reliable transport connection from a client terminates,
all work in progress by that client is terminated by the server and all
resources open by that client on the server are closed. Message
transport is done using NETBIOS session service (see section 5.3 of RFC
1001 and section 4.3 of RFC 1002).


<a name="s2.6.1">2.6.1</a>  Connection Establishment

After the server name has been resolved to an IP address, then a
connection to the server needs to be established if one has not already
been set up. Connection establishment is done using the Call primitive
of the NETBIOS session service, which requires the client to provide a
"calling name" and a "called name". The calling name is not significant
in CIFS, except that an identical name from the same transport address

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


is assumed to represent the same client; the called name is always
"*SMBSERVER      ". Over TCP, the Call primitive results in a "Session
Request" packet to port 139 (see section 4.3.2 of RFC 1002).


<a name="s2.6.1.1">2.6.1.1</a>  Backwards compatability

If a CIFS client wishes to interoperate with older SMB servers, then if
the Call is rejected by the server, it can retry with a new called name.
The choice of the new called name depends on the name resolution
mechanism used. If DNS was used, the called name should be constructed
from the first component of the server's DNS name, truncated to 15
characters if necessary, and then padded to 16 characters with blank (20
hex) characters. If NETBIOS was used, then the called named is just the
NETBIOS name. If these fail, then a NETBIOS "Adapter Status" request may
be made to obtain the server's NETBIOS name, and the connection
establishment retried with that as the called name.


<a name="s2.6.2">2.6.2</a>  Server-side Connection Procedures

A CIFS server MUST register a NETBIOS Listen that accepts any calling
name on the name "*SMBSERVER     ".

In addition, if it wishes to support older SMB clients, it MAY have a
NETBIOS name and register a Listen on that name.


<a name="s2.6.3">2.6.3</a>  Connection Management

Once a connection is established, the rules for reliable transport
connection dissolution are:

o If a server receives a transport establishment request from a client
  with which it is already conversing, the server may terminate all
  other transport connections to that client.  This is to recover from
  the situation where the client was suddenly rebooted and was unable
  to cleanly terminate its resource sharing activities with the server.

o A server may drop the transport connection to a client at any time if
  the client is generating malformed or illogical requests.  However,
  wherever possible the server should first return an error code to the
  client indicating the cause of the abort.

o If a server gets a hard error on the transport (such as a send
  failure) the transport connection to that client may be aborted.

o A server may terminate the transport connection when the client has
  no open resources on the server, however, we recommend that the
  termination be performed only after some time has passed or if
  resources are scarce on the server.  This will help performance in
  that the transport connection will not need to be reestablished if
  activity soon begins anew. Client software is expected to be able to
  automatically reconnect to the server if this happens..

<a name="s2.7">2.7</a>  Opportunistic Locks

Network performance can be increased if the client can locally buffer
file data.  For example, the client does not have to write information
into a file on the server if the client knows that no other process is
accessing the data.  Likewise, the client can buffer read-ahead data
from the file if the client knows that no other process is writing the
data.

The mechanism which allows clients to dynamically alter their buffering
strategy in a consistent manner is knows as "opportunistic locks", or
oplocks for short.  Versions of the CIFS file sharing protocol including
and newer than the "LANMAN1.0" dialect support oplocks.

There are three different types of oplocks:

o An exclusive oplock allows a client to open a file for exclusive
  access and allows the client to perform arbitrary buffering

o A batch oplock allows a client to keep a file open on the server even
  though the local accessor on the client machine has closed the file.

o A Level II oplock indicates there are multiple readers of a file, and
  no writers.  Level II oplocks are supported if the negotiated dialect
  is NT LM 0.12 or later.

When a client opens a file, it requests the server to grant it a
particular type of oplock on the file.  The response from the server
indicates the type of oplock granted to the client.  The client uses the
granted oplock type to adjust its buffering policy.

The SMB_COM_LOCKING_ANDX SMB is used to convey oplock break and response
information.


<a name="s2.7.1">2.7.1</a>  Exclusive Oplocks

If a client is granted an exclusive oplock, it may buffer lock
information, read-ahead data, and write data on the client because the
client knows that it is the only accessor to the file.  The basic
protocol is that the redirector on the client opens the file requesting
that an oplock be given to the client.  If the file is open by anyone
else, then the client is refused the oplock and no local buffering may
be performed on the local client.  This also means that no readahead may
be performed to the file, unless the redirector knows that it has the
read ahead range locked.  If the server grants the exclusive oplock, the
client can perform certain optimizations for the file such as buffering
lock, read, and write data.

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


The exclusive oplock protocol is:


   Client                       &lt;-&gt; Server

   A               B
   ==============  ===========  === ================================

   Open ("foo")                 -&gt;
                                &lt;-  Open OK.  Exclusive oplock
                                     granted.
                   Open("foo")  -&gt;
                                &lt;-  oplock break to A
   lock(s)                      -&gt;
                                &lt;-  lock(s) response(s)
   write(s)                     -&gt;
                                &lt;-  write(s) response(s)
   close or done                -&gt;
                                &lt;-  open response to B



As can be seen, when client A opens the file, it can request an
exclusive oplock.  Provided no one else has the file open on the server,
then the oplock is granted to client A.  If, at some point in the
future, another client, such as client B, requests an open to the same
file, then the server must have client A break its oplock.  Breaking the
oplock involves client A sending the server any lock or write data that
it has buffered, and then letting the server know that it has
acknowledged that the oplock has been broken.  This synchronization
message informs the server that it is now permissible to allow client B
to complete its open.

Client A must also purge any readahead buffers that it has for the file.
This is not shown in the above diagram since no network traffic is
needed to do this.


<a name="s2.7.2">2.7.2</a>  Batch Oplocks

Batch oplocks are used where common programs on a client behave in such
a way that causes the amount of network traffic on a wire to go beyond
an acceptable level for the functionality provided by the program.

For example, the command processor executes commands from within a
command procedure by performing the following steps:

  o Opening the command procedure.

  o Seeking to the "next" line in the file.

  o Reading the line from the file.

  o Closing the file.

  o Executing the command.



Leach, Naik       expires September, 1997         [Page 14] 


INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


This process is repeated for each command executed from the command
procedure file.  As is obvious, this type of programming model causes an
inordinate amount of processing of files, thereby creating a lot of
network traffic that could otherwise be curtailed if the program were to
simply open the file, read a line, execute the command, and then read
the next line.

Batch oplocking curtails the amount of network traffic by allowing the
client to skip the extraneous open and close requests.  When the command
processor then asks for the next line in the file, the client can either
ask for the next line from the server, or it may have already read the
data from the file as readahead data.  In either case, the amount of
network traffic from the client is greatly reduced.

If the server receives either a rename or a delete request for the file
that has a batch oplock, it must inform the client that the oplock is to
be broken.  The client can then change to a mode where the file is
repeatedly opened and closed.

The batch oplock protocol is:



   Client                    &lt;-&gt;  Server

   A            B
   ===========  ============ ==== ===============================

   Open("foo")               -&gt;
                             &lt;-   Open OK.  Batch oplock granted.
   Read                      -&gt;
                             &lt;-   data
   &lt;close&gt;
   &lt;open&gt;
   &lt;seek&gt;
                             -&gt;   read
                             &lt;-   data
   &lt;close&gt;
                Open("foo")  -&gt;
                             &lt;-   Oplock break to A
   Close                     -&gt;
                             &lt;-   Close OK to A
                             &lt;-   Open OK to B



When client A opens the file, it can request an oplock.  Provided no one
else has the file open on the server, then the oplock is granted to
client A.  Client A, in this case, keeps the file open for its caller
across multiple open/close operations.  Data may be read ahead for the
caller and other optimizations, such as buffering locks, can also be
performed.

When another client requests an open, rename, or delete operation to the
server for the file, however, client A must cleanup its buffered data
and synchronize with the server.  Most of the time this involves
actually closing the file, provided that client A's caller actually

believes that he has closed the file.  Once the file is actually closed,
client B's open request can be completed.


<a name="s2.7.3">2.7.3</a>  Level II Oplocks

Level II oplocks allow multiple clients to have the same file open,
providing that no client is performing write operations to the file.
This is important for many environments because most compatibility mode
opens from down-level clients map to an open request for shared
read/write access to the file.  While it makes sense to do this, it also
tends to break oplocks for other clients even though neither client
actually intends to write to the file.

The Level II oplock protocol is:



   Client                    &lt;-&gt;  Server

   A            B
   ===========  ===========  ==== ====================================

   Open("foo")               -&gt;
                             &lt;-   Open OK.  Exclusive oplock granted.
   Read                      -&gt;
                             &lt;-   data
                Open("foo")  -&gt;
                             &lt;-   Break to Level II oplock to A
   lock(s)                   -&gt;
                             &lt;-   lock(s) response(s)
   done                      -&gt;
                             &lt;-   Open OK.  Oplock II oplock granted
                                   to B


This sequence of events is very much like an exclusive oplock.  The
basic difference is that the server informs the client that it should
break to a level II lock when no one has been writing the file.  That
is, client A, for example, may have opened the file for a desired access
of READ, and a share access of READ/WRITE.  This means, by definition,
that client A will not performed any writes to the file.

When client B opens the file, the server must synchronize with client A
in case client A has any buffered locks.  Once it is synchronized,
client B's open request may be completed.  Client B, however, is
informed that he has a level II oplock, rather than an exclusive oplock
to the file.

In this case, no client that has the file open with a level II oplock
may buffer any lock information on the local client machine.  This
allows the server to guarantee that if any write operation is performed,
it need only notify the level II clients that the lock should be broken
without having to synchronize all of the accessors of the file.

The level II oplock may be broken to none, meaning that some client that
had the file opened has now performed a write operation to the file.

Because no level II client may buffer lock information, the server is in
a consistent state.  The writing client, for example, could not have
written to a locked range, by definition.  Read ahead data may be
buffered in the client machines, however, thereby cutting down on the
amount of network traffic required to the file.  Once the level II
oplock is broken, however, the buffering client must flush its buffers
and degrade to performing all operations on the file across the network.
No oplock break response is expected from a client when the server
breaks a client from level II to none.


<a name="s2.8">2.8</a>  Security Model

Each server makes a set of resources available to clients on the
network.  A resource being shared may be a directory tree, named pipe,
printer, etc.  So far as clients are concerned, the server has no
storage or service dependencies on any other servers; a client considers
the server to be the sole provider of the file (or other resource) being
accessed.

The CIFS protocol requires server authentication of users before file
accesses are allowed, and each server authenticates its own users.  A
client system must send authentication information to the server before
the server will allow access to its resources.

The CIFS protocol defines two methods which can be selected by the
server for security:  share level and user level:


o A share level server makes some directory on a disk device (or other
  resource) available.  An optional password may be required to gain
  access.  Thus any user on the network who knows the name of the
  server, the name of the resource and the password has access to the
  resource.  Share level security servers may use different passwords
  for the same shared resource with different passwords allowing
  different levels of access.


o A user level server makes some directory on a disk device (or other
  resource) available but in addition requires the client to provide a
  user name and corresponding user password to gain access. User level
  servers are preferred over share level servers for any new server
  implementation, since organizations generally find user level servers
  easier to administer as employees come and go. User level servers may 
  use the account name to check access control lists on individual
  files, or may have one access control list that applies to all files
  in the directory.

When a user level server validates the account name and password
presented by the client, an identifier representing that authenticated
instance of the user is returned to the client in the Uid field of the
response SMB.  This Uid must be included in all further requests made on
behalf of the user from that client.  A share level server returns no
useful information in the Uid field.



Leach, Naik       expires September, 1997         [Page 17] 


INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


The user level security model was added after the original dialect of
the CIFS protocol was issued, and subsequently some clients may not be
capable of sending account name and passwords to the server.  A server
in user level security mode communicating with one of these clients will
allow a client to connect to resources even if the client has not sent
account name and password information:

1. If the client's computer name is identical to an account-name known
on the server, and if the password supplied to connect to the shared
resource matches that account's password, an implicit "user logon" will
be performed using those values.

If the above fails, the server may fail the request or assign a default
account name of its choice.

2. The value of Uid in subsequent requests by the client will be ignored
and all access will be validated assuming the account name selected
above.


<a name="s2.9">2.9</a>  Resource Share/Access Example

The following examples illustrate a possible command line user interface
for a server to offer a disk resource, and for a client to connect to
and use that resource.

a) NET SHARE

The NET SHARE command, when executed on the server, specifies a
directory name to be made available to clients on the network.  A share
name must be given, and this name is presented by clients wishing to
access the directory.

  Examples:

     NET SHARE  src=c:\dir1\src  "bonzo"

     assigns password bonzo to all files within directory c:\dir1\src
     and its subdirectories with the share name src being the name used
     to connect to this resource.

  NET SHARE  c=c:\        " "        RO

  NET SHARE  work=c:\work  "flipper"  RW

     offers read-only access to everything on the C drive. Offers read-
     write access to all files within the C:\work directory and its
     subdirectories.

The above example is appropriate for servers operating as a share level
server.  A user level server would not require the permissions or
password, since the combination of the client's account name and
specific access control lists on files is sufficient to govern access.

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


b) NET USE

Clients can gain access to one or more offered directories via the NET
USE command.  Once the NET USE command is issued the user can access the
files freely without further special requirements.

  Examples:

  1.  NET USE  d: \\Server1\src  "bonzo"

     gains full access to the files and directories on Server1 matching
     the offer defined by the netname src with the password of bonzo.
     The user may now address files on Server1 c:\dir1\src by
     referencing d:. E.g. "type d:srcfile1.c".

  2.  NET USE  e: \\Server1\c

  3.  NET USE  f: \\Server1\work   "flipper"

     Now any read request to any file on that node (drive c) is valid
     (e.g. "type e:\bin\foo.bat").  Read-write requests only succeed to
     files whose pathnames start with f: (e.g. "copy foo f:foo.tmp"
     copies foo to Server1 c:\work\foo.tmp).

For user level servers, the client would not provide a password with the
NET USE command.

The client software must remember the drive identifier supplied with the
NET USE request and associate it with the Tid value returned by the
server in the SMB header.  Subsequent requests using this Tid must
include only the pathname relative to the connected subtree as the
server treats the subtree as the root directory (virtual root).  When
the user references one of the remote drives, the client software looks
through its list of drives for that node and includes the tree id
associated with this drive in the Tid field of each request.

Note that one shares a directory and all files underneath that directory
are then affected.  If a particular file is within the range of multiple
shares, connecting to any of the share ranges gains access to the file
with the permissions specified for the offer named in the NET USE.  The
server will not check for nested directories with more restrictive
permissions.


<a name="s2.10">2.10</a>  Authentication

An CIFS server keeps an encrypted form of a client's password.  To gain
authenticated access to server resources, the server sends a challenge
to the client, which the client responds to in a way that proves it
knows the client's password.

Authentication makes use of DES encryption [5] in block mode.  We denote
the DES encryption function as E(K,D), which accepts a seven byte key
(K) and an eight byte data block (D) and produces an eight byte

Leach, Naik       expires September, 1997         [Page 19] 


INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


encrypted data block as its value.  If the data to be encrypted is
longer than eight bytes, the encryption function is applied to each
block of eight bytes in sequence and the results are appended together.
If the key is longer than seven bytes, the data is first completely
encrypted using the first seven bytes of the key, then the second seven
bytes, etc., appending the results each time.  In other words, to
encrypt the 16 byte quantity D0D1 with the 14 byte key K0K1,

    E(K0K1,D0D1) = E(K0,D0)E(K0,D1)E(K1,D0)E(K1,D1)

The EncryptionKey field in the SMB_COM_NEGPROT response contains an 8
byte challenge denoted below as "C8", chosen to be unique to prevent
replay attacks; the client responds with a 24 byte response denoted
"P24", and computed as described below. (Note: the name "EncryptionKey"
is historical -- it doesn't actually hold an encryption key.)

Clients send the response to the challenge in the SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT,
SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT_ANDX, and/or SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX request
which follows the SMB_COM_NEGPROT message exchange.  The server must
validate the response by performing the same computations the client did
to create it, and ensuring the strings match.

If the comparisons fail, the client system may be incapable of
encryption; if so the string may be the user password in clear text.
The server should try to validating the string as though it were the
unencrypted password.

The SMB field used to store the response depends upon the request:

     o Password in SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT

     o Password in SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT_ANDX

     o AccountPassword in SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX

(Note: again, the names are historical, and do not reflect this usage.)

The contents of the response to the challenge depends on the CIFS
dialect, as outlined in the following sections:


<a name="s2.10.1">2.10.1</a>  Pre NT LM 0.12

     sensitive, no maximum length

<a name="s2.11">2.11</a>  Distributed Filesystem (DFS) Support

Protocol dialects of NT LM 0.12 and later support distributed filesystem
operations. The distributed filesystem gives a way for this protocol to
use a single consistent file naming scheme which may span a collection
of different servers and shares. The distributed filesystem model
employed is a referral - based model. This protocol specifies the manner
in which clients receive referrals.

The client can set a flag in the request SMB header indicating that the
client wants the server to resolve this SMB's paths within the DFS known
to the server. The server attempts to resolve the requested name to a
file contained within the local directory tree indicated by the TID of
the request and proceeds normally. If the request pathname resolves to a
file on a different system, the server returns the following error:

  STATUS_DFS_PATH_NOT_COVERED - the server does not support the part
  of the DFS namespace needed to resolved the pathname in the request.

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


  The client should request a referral from this server for further
  information.

A client asks for a referral with the TRANS2_DFS_GET_REFERRAL request
containing the DFS pathname of interest. The response from the server
indicates how the client should proceed.

The method by which the topological knowledge of the DFS is stored and
maintained by the servers is not specified by this protocol.

                                                       ============

 0   When set (returned) from the server in the        LANMAN1.0
     SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE response SMB, this bit
     indicates that the server  supports the "sub
     dialect" consisting of the LockandRead and
     WriteandUnlock protocols defined later in this
     document.
 1   When on (on an SMB request being sent to the
     server), the client guarantees that there is a
     receive buffer posted such that a send without
     acknowledgment can be used by the server to
     respond to the client's request.
 2   Reserved (must be zero).
 3   When on, all pathnames in this SMB must be        LANMAN1.0
     treated as caseless.  When off, the pathnames
     are case sensitive.
 4   When on (in  SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX  defined  LANMAN1.0
     later in this document), all paths sent to the
     server by the client are already canonicalized.
     This means that file/directory names are in
     upper case, are valid characters, . and .. have
     been removed, and single backslashes are used as
     separators.
 5   When on (in  SMB_COM_OPEN, SMB_COM_CREATE and     LANMAN1.0
     SMB_COM_CREATE_NEW), this indicates that the
     client is requesting that the file be
     "opportunistically" locked if this process is
     the only process which has the file open at the
     time of the open request.  If the server
     "grants" this oplock request, then this bit
     should remain set in the corresponding response
     SMB to indicate to the client that the oplock
     request was granted.  See the discussion of
     "oplock" in the sections defining the
     SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX and SMB_COM_LOCKING_ANDX
     protocols later in this document (this bit has
     the same function as bit 1 of Flags if the
     SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX SMB).
 6   When on (in core protocols SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX,     LANMAN1.0
     SMB_COM_CREATE and SMB_COM_CREATE_NEW), this
     indicates that the server should notify the
     client on any action which can modify the file
     (delete, setattrib, rename, etc.) by another
     client.  If not set, the server need only notify
     the client about another open request by a
     different client.  See the discussion of
     "oplock" in the sections defining the
     SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX  and SMB_COM_LOCKING_ANDX SMBs

     function as bit 2 of smb_flags of the
     SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX SMB).  Bit6 only has meaning

 7   When on, this SMB is being sent from the server   PC NETWORK
     in response to a client request.  The Command     PROGRAM 1.0
     field usually contains the same value in a
     protocol request from the client to the server
     as in the matching response from the server to
     the client.  This bit unambiguously
     distinguishes the command request from the

      Otherwise the Status.DosError.ErrorClass and

<a name="s3.1.3">3.1.3</a>  Tid Field

Tid represents an instance of an authenticated connection to a server
resource.  Tid is returned by the server to the client when the client
successfully connects to a resource, and the client uses Tid in
subsequent requests referring to the resource.

If the server is executing in share level security mode, Tid is the only
thing used to allow access to the shared resource. Thus if the user is
able to perform a successful connection to the server specifying the
appropriate netname and passwd (if any) the resource may be accessed



Leach, Naik       expires September, 1997         [Page 24]

according to the access rights associated with the shared resource (same
for all who gained access this way).

If however the server is executing in user level security mode, access
to the resource is based on the Uid (validated on the
SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX request) and the Tid is NOT associated with
access control but rather merely defines the resource (such as the
shared directory tree).

In most SMB requests, Tid must contain a valid value. Exceptions include
prior to getting a Tid established including SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE,
SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT, SMB_COM_ECHO, and SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX.
0xFFFF should be used for Tid for these situations.  The server is
always responsible for enforcing use of a valid Tid where appropriate.</pre>

<font color="GREEN">[In practice, a value of 0x0000 is used instead of
0xFFFF.]</font>
<pre>

<a name="s3.1.4">3.1.4</a>  Pid Field

Pid uniquely identifies a client process.  Clients inform servers of the
creation of a new process by simply introducing a new Pid value into the
dialogue for new processes.

In the core protocol, the SMB_COM_PROCESS_EXIT SMB was used to indicate
the catastrophic termination of a process on the client.  In the single
tasking DOS system, it was possible for hard errors to occur causing the
destruction of the process with files remaining open.  Thus a
SMB_COM_PROCESS_EXIT SMB was sent for this occurrence to allow the
server to close all files opened by that process.

In the LANMAN 1.0 and newer dialects, no SMB_COM_PROCESS_EXIT SMB is
sent.  The client operating system must ensure that the appropriate
close and cleanup SMBs will be sent when the last process referencing
the file closes it.  From the server's point of view, there is no
concept of FIDs "belonging to" processes.  A FID returned by the server
to one process may be used by any other process using the same transport
connection and Tid.  There is no process creation SMB sent to the
server; it is up to the client to ensure only valid client processes
gain access to Fids (and Tids).  On SMB_COM_TREE_DISCONNECT (or when the
client and server session is terminated) the server will invalidate any
files opened by any process on that client.


<a name="s3.1.5">3.1.5</a>  Mid Field

Clients using the LANMAN 1.0 and newer dialects will typically be
multitasked and allow multiple asynchronous input/output requests per
task.  Therefore a multiplex ID (Mid) is used along with Pid to allow
multiplexing the single client and server connection among the client's
multiple processes, threads, and requests per thread.

Regardless of negotiated dialect, the server is responsible for ensuring
that every response contains the same Mid and Pid values as its request.
The client may then use the Mid and Pid values for associating requests

and responses and may have up to the negotiated number of requests
outstanding at any time to a particular server.


<a name="s3.1.6">3.1.6</a>  Status Field

An SMB returns error information to the client in the Status field.
Protocol dialects prior to NT LM 0.12 return status to the client using
the combination of Status.DosError.ErrorClass and Status.DosError.Error.
Beginning with NT LM 0.12 CIFS servers can return 32 bit error
information to clients using Status.Status if the incoming client SMB
has bit 14 set in the Flags2 field of the SMB header. The contents of
response parameters is not guaranteed in the case of an error return,
and must be ignored.  For write behind activity, a subsequent write or
close of the file may return the fact that a previous write failed.
Normally write behind failures are limited to hard disk errors and
device out of space.


<a name="s3.1.7">3.1.7</a>  Timeouts

In general, SMBs are not expected to block at the server; they should
return "immediately".  But some SMB requests do indicate timeout periods
for the completion of the request on the server.  If a server
implementation can not support timeouts, then an error can be returned
just as if a timeout had occurred if the resource is not available
immediately upon request.


<a name="s3.1.8">3.1.8</a>  Data Buffer (BUFFER) and String Formats

The data portion of SMBs typically contains the data to be read or
written, file paths, or directory paths.  The format of the data portion
depends on the message.  All fields in the data portion have the same
format.  In every case it consists of an identifier byte followed by the
data.




           Identifier       Description               Value
           ===============  ========================= =====

           Data Block       See Below                 1
           Dialect          Null terminated String    2
           Pathname         Null terminated String    3

           Variable block   See Below                 5



When the identifier indicates a data block or variable block then the
format is a word indicating the length followed by the data.

In all dialects prior to NT LM 0.12, all strings are encoded in ASCII.
If the agreed dialect is NT LM 0.12 or later, Unicode strings may be

exchanged. Unicode strings include file names, resource names, and user
names.  This applies to null-terminated strings, length specified
strings and the type-prefixed strings.  In all cases where a string is
passed in Unicode format, the Unicode string must be word-aligned with
respect to the beginning of the SMB.  Should the string not naturally
fall on a two-byte boundary, a null byte of padding will be inserted,
and the Unicode string will begin at the next address.  In the
description of the SMBs, items that may be encoded in Unicode or ASCII
are labeled as STRING.  If the encoding is ASCII, even if the negotiated
string is Unicode, the quantity is labeled as UCHAR.

For type-prefixed Unicode strings, the padding byte is found after the
type byte.  The type byte is 4 (indicating SMB_FORMAT_ASCII) independent
of whether the string is ASCII or Unicode. For strings whose start
addresses are found using offsets within the fixed part of the SMB (as
opposed to simply being found at the byte following the preceding
field,) it is guaranteed that the offset will be properly aligned.

Strings that are never passed in Unicode are:

  o The protocol strings in the Negotiate SMB request.

  o The service name string in the Tree Connect And X SMB.

When Unicode is negotiated, bit 15 should be set in the Flags2 field of
every SMB header.

Despite the flexible encoding scheme, no field of a data portion may be
omitted or included out of order.  In addition, neither an WordCount nor
ByteCount of value 0 at the end of a message may be omitted.


<a name="s3.2">3.2</a>  File Names

File names in the CIFS protocol consist of components separated by a
backslash ('\').  Early clients of the CIFS protocol required that the
name components adhere to an 8.3 format name.  These names consist of
two parts:  a basename of no more than 8 characters, and an extension of
no more than 3 characters.  The basename and extension are separated by
a '.'.  All characters are legal in the basename and extension except
the space character (0x20) and:

     " . / \[]:+|&lt;&gt;=;,*?

If the client has indicated long name support by setting bit2 in the
Flags2 field of the SMB header, this indicates that the client is not
bound by the 8.3 convention.  Specifically this indicates that any SMB
which returns file names to the client may return names which do not
adhere to the 8.3 convention, and have a total length of up to 255
characters.  This capability was introduced with the LM1.2X002 protocol
dialect.

<a name="s3.3">3.3</a>  Wildcards

Some SMB requests allow wildcards to be given for the filename.  The
wildcard allows a number of files to be operated on as a unit without
having to separately enumerate the files and individually operate on
each one from the client.

If the client is using 8.3 names, each part of the name ( base (8) or
extension (3) ) is treated separately.  For long filenames the . in the
name is significant even though there is no longer a restriction on the
size of each of the components.

The ? character is a wild card for a single character. If a filename
part commences with one or more "?"s then exactly that number of
characters will be matched by the wildcards, e.g., "??x" equals "abx"
but not "abcx" or "ax".  When a filename part has trailing "?"s then it
matches the specified number of characters or less, e.g., "x??" matches
"xab", "xa" and "x", but not "xabc".  If only "?"s are present in the
filename part, then it is handled as for trailing "?"s

The * character matches an entire part of the name, as does an empty
specification for that part.  A part consisting of * means that the rest
of the component should be filled with ? and the search should be
performed with this wildcard character.  For example, "*.abc" or ".abc"
match any file with an extension of "abc".  "*.*", "*" or "null" match
all files in a directory.

If the negotiated dialect is "NT LM 0.12" or later, and the client
requires MS-DOS wildcard matching semantics,  UNICODE wildcards should
be translated according to the following rules:

    Translate the ? literal to &gt;

    Translate the . literal to " if it is followed by a ? or a *

    Translate the * literal to &lt; if it is followed by a .

The translation can be performed in-place.


<a name="s3.4">3.4</a>  DFS Pathnames

A DFS pathname adheres to the standard described in the FileNames
section.  A DFS enabled client accessing a DFS share should set the
Flags2 bit 12 in all name based SMB requests indicating to the server
that the enclosed pathname should be resolved in the Distributed File
System namespace. The pathname should always have the full file name,
including the server name and share name. If the server can resolve the
DFS name to a piece of local storage, the local storage will be
accessed. If the server determines that the DFS name actually maps to a
different server share, the access to the name will fail with the 32 bit
status STATUS_PATH_NOT_COVERED (0xC0000257), or DOS error
ERRsrv/ERRbadpath.


Leach, Naik       expires September, 1997         [Page 28] 


INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


On receiving this error, the DFS enabled client should ask the server
for a referral (see TRANS2_GET_DFS_REFERRAL). The referral request
should contain the full file name.

The response to the request will contain a list of server and share
names to try, and the part of the request file name that junctions to
the list of server shares. If the ServerType field of the referral is
set to 1 (SMB server), then the client should resubmit the request with
the original file name to one of the server shares in the list, once
again setting the Flags2 bit 12 bit in the SMB. If the ServerType field
is not 1, then the client should strip off the part of the file name
that junctions to the server share before resubmitting the request to
one of servers in the list.

A response to a referral request may elicit a response that does not
have the StorageServers bit set. In that case, the client should
resubmit the referral request to one of the servers in the list, until
it finally obtains a referral response that has the StorageServers bit
set, at which point the client can resubmit the request SMB to one of
the listed server shares.

If, after getting a referral with the StorageServers bit set and
resubmitting the request to one of the server shares in the list, the
server fails the request with STATUS_PATH_NOT_COVERED, it must be the
case that there is an inconsistency between the view of the DFS
namespace held by the server granting the referral and the server listed
in that referral. In this case, the client may inform the server
granting the referral of this inconsistency via the
TRANS2_REPORT_DFS_INCONSISTENCY SMB.


<a name="s3.5">3.5</a>  Time And Date Encoding

When SMB requests or responses encode time values, the following
describes the various encodings used.

        USHORT Day : 5;
        USHORT Month : 4;
        USHORT Year : 7;
} SMB_DATE;



The Year field has a range of 0-119, which represents years 1980 - 2099.
The Month is encoded as 1-12, and the day ranges from 1-31

Hours ranges from 0-23, Minutes range from 0-59, and TwoSeconds ranges
from 0-29 representing two second increments within the minute.

typedef struct {
    ULONG LowTime;
    LONG HighTime;
} TIME;



TIME indicates a signed 64-bit integer representing either an absolute
time or a time interval.  Times are specified in units of 100ns.  A
positive value expresses an absolute time, where the base time (the 64-
bit integer with value 0) is the beginning of the year 1601 AD in the
Gregorian calendar.  A negative value expresses a time interval relative
to some base time, usually the current time.

UTIME is the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970, 00:00:00.0.


<a name="s3.6">3.6</a>  Access Mode Encoding

Various client requests and server responses, such as SMB_COM_OPEN, pass

ATTR_ARCHIVE     0x020 The file has not been archived since it was
                       last modified. Applications use this
                       attribute to mark files for backup or
                       removal.
ATTR_COMPRESSED  0x800 The file or directory is compressed. For a
                       file, this means that all of the data in the

                             caching; the server is not obliged to
                             honor the request. An application must
                             meet certain requirements when working

                             bytes, an application can request reads
                             and writes of 512, 1024, or 2048 bytes,
                             but not of 335, 981, or 7171 bytes.
RANDOM_ACCESS    0x10000000 Indicates that the application intends
                             to access the file randomly. The server
                             MAY use this flag to optimize file
                             caching.
SEQUENTIAL_SCAN  0x08000000 Indicates that the file is to be
                             accessed sequentially from beginning to
                             end. Windows uses this flag to optimize
                             file caching. If an application moves
                             the file pointer for random access,
                             optimum caching may not occur; however,
                             correct operation is still guaranteed.
                             Specifying this flag can increase
                             performance for applications that read
                             large files using sequential access.
                             Performance gains can be even more
                             noticeable for applications that read
                             large files mostly sequentially, but
                             occasionally skip over small ranges of
                             bytes.
DELETE_ON_CLOSE  0x04000000 Requests that the server is delete the
                             file immediately after all of its
                             handles have been closed.
BACKUP_SEMANTICS 0x02000000 Indicates that the file is being opened
                             or created for a backup or restore
                             operation. The server SHOULD allow the
                             client to override normal file security
                             checks, provided it has the necessary
                             permission to do so.

                             includes allowing multiple files with
                             names differing only in case, for file
                             systems that support such naming. (Use
                             care when using this option because
                             files created with this flag may not be
                             accessible by applications written for

<a name="s3.12">3.12</a>  Batching Requests ("AndX" Messages)

LANMAN1.0 and later dialects of the CIFS protocol allow multiple SMB
requests to be sent in one message to the server.  Messages of this type
are called AndX SMBs, and they obey the following rules:

o The embedded command does not repeat the SMB header information.
  Rather the next SMB starts at the WordCount field.

o All multiple (chained) requests must fit within the negotiated
  transmit size.  For example, if SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT_ANDX included
  OPENandX SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX which included SMB_COM_WRITE were sent,
  they would all have to fit within the negotiated buffer size.  This
  would limit the size of the write.

o There is one message sent containing the chained requests and there
  is one response message to the chained requests.  The server may NOT
  elect to send separate responses to each of the chained requests.

o All chained responses must fit within the negotiated transmit size.
  This limits the maximum value on an embedded SMB_COM_READ for
  example.  It is the client's responsibility to not request more bytes
  than will fit within the multiple response.

o The server will implicitly use the result of the first command in the
  "X" command.  For example the Tid obtained via
  SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT_ANDX would be used in the embedded
  SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX and the Fid obtained in the SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX would
  be used in the embedded SMB_COM_READ.

o Each chained request can only reference the same Fid and Tid as the
  other commands in the combined request.  The chained requests can be
  thought of as performing a single (multi-part) operation on the same
  resource.

o The first Command to encounter an error will stop all further
  processing of embedded commands.  The server will not back out
  commands that succeeded.  Thus if a chained request contained
  SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX and SMB_COM_READ and the server was able to open
  the file successfully but the read encountered an error, the file
  would remain open.  This is exactly the same as if the requests had
  been sent separately.

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


o If an error occurs while processing chained requests, the last
  response (of the chained responses in the buffer) will be the one
  which encountered the error.  Other unprocessed chained requests will
  have been ignored when the server encountered the error and will not
  be represented in the chained response.  Actually the last valid
  AndXCommand (if any) will represent the SMB on which the error
  occurred.  If no valid AndXCommand is present, then the error
  occurred on the first request/response and Command contains the
  command which failed.  In all cases the error information are
  returned in the SMB header at the start of the response buffer.

o Each chained request and response contains the offset (from the start
  of the SMB header) to the next chained request/response (in the
  AndXOffset field in the various "and X" protocols defined later e.g.
  SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX).  This allows building the requests unpacked.
  There may be space between the end of the previous request (as
  defined by WordCount and ByteCount) and the start of the next chained
  request.  This simplifies the building of chained protocol requests.
  Note that because the client must know the size of the data being
  returned in order to post the correct number of receives (e.g.
  SMB_COM_TRANSACTION, SMB_COM_READ_MPX), the data in each response SMB
  is expected to be truncated to the maximum number of 512 byte blocks
  (sectors) which will fit (starting at a 32 bit boundary) in the
  negotiated buffer size with the odd bytes remaining (if any) in the
  final buffer.


<a name="s3.13">3.13</a>  "Transaction" Style Subprotocols

SMB_COM_TRANSACTION performs a symbolically named transaction.  This
transaction is known only by a name (no file handle used).
SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2 likewise performs a transaction, but a word
parameter is used to identify the transaction instead of a name.
SMB_COM_NT_TRANSACTION is used for commands that potentially need to
transfer a large amount of data (greater than 64K bytes).

specific to a particular resource on a particular server.  Therefore the
functions supported are not defined by the protocol, but by client and
server implementations.  The transaction protocol simply provides a
means of delivering them and retrieving the results.

The number of bytes needed in order to perform the transaction request
may be more than will fit in a single buffer.

At the time of the request, the client knows the number of parameter and
data bytes expected to be sent and passes this information to the server
via the primary request (TotalParameterCount and TotalDataCount).  This
may be reduced by lowering the total number of bytes expected
(TotalParameterCount and TotalDataCount) in each (if any) secondary
request.

When the amount of parameter bytes received (total of each
ParameterCount) equals the total amount of parameter bytes expected
(smallest TotalParameterCount) received, then the server has received
all the parameter bytes.

Likewise, when the amount of data bytes received (total of each
DataCount) equals the total amount of data bytes expected (smallest
TotalDataCount) received, then the server has received all the data
bytes.

The parameter bytes should normally be sent first followed by the data
bytes.  However, the server knows where each begins and ends in each
buffer by the offset fields (ParameterOffset and DataOffset) and the
length fields (ParameterCount and DataCount).  The displacement of the
bytes (relative to start of each) is also known (ParameterDisplacement
and DataDisplacement).  Thus the server is able to reassemble the
parameter and data bytes should the individual requests be received out
of sequence.

If all parameter bytes and data bytes fit into a single buffer, then no
interim response is expected and no secondary request is sent.

The client knows the maximum amount of data bytes and parameter bytes
which the server may return (from MaxParameterCount and MaxDataCount of
the request).  Thus the client initializes its bytes expected variables
to these values.  The server then informs the client of the actual
amounts being returned via each message of the server response
(TotalParameterCount and TotalDataCount).  The server may reduce the
expected bytes by lowering the total number of bytes expected
(TotalParameterCount and/or TotalDataCount) in each (any) response.

When the amount of parameter bytes received (total of each
ParameterCount) equals the total amount of parameter bytes expected
(smallest TotalParameterCount) received, then the client has received
all the parameter bytes.

Likewise, when the amount of data bytes received (total of each
DataCount) equals the total amount of data bytes expected (smallest
TotalDataCount) received, then the client has received all the data
bytes.

The parameter bytes should normally be returned first followed by the
data bytes.  However, the client knows where each begins and ends in
each buffer by the offset fields (ParameterOffset and DataOffset) and
the length fields (ParameterCount and DataCount).  The displacement of
the bytes (relative to start of each) is also known
(ParameterDisplacement and DataDisplacement).  The client is able to
reassemble the parameter and data bytes should the server responses be
received out of sequence.

If a connectionless transport is being used, the transaction requests
must be properly sequenced in the Connectionless.SequenceNumber SMB
header field.  The Mid of any secondary client requests must match the
Mid of the primary client request.  The server responds to each request

piece except the last one with a response indicating that the server is
ready for the next piece.  The last piece is responded to with the first
piece of the result data.  The client then sends an
SMB_COM_TRANSACTION_SECONDARY SMB with ParameterDisplacement set to the
number of parameter bytes received so far and DataDisplacement set to
the number of data bytes received so far and ParameterCount,
ParameterOffset, DataCount, and DataOffset set to zero (0).  The server
responds with the next piece of the transaction result.  The process is
repeated until all of the response information has been received.  When
the transaction has been completed, the client must send another
sequenced command (such as an SMB_COM_ECHO) to the server to allow the
server to know that the final piece was received and that resources
allocated to the transaction command may be released.

The flow for these transactions over a connection oriented transport is:

1.     The client sends the primary client request identifying the total
bytes (both parameters and data) which are expected to be sent and
contains the set up words and as many of the parameter and data bytes
as will fit in a negotiated size buffer.  This request also identifies
the maximum number of bytes (setup, parameters and data) the server is
to return on the transaction completion.  If all the bytes fit in the
single buffer, skip to step 4.

2.     The server responds with a single interim response meaning "OK, send
the remainder of the bytes" or (if error response) terminate the
transaction.

3.     The client then sends another buffer full of bytes to the server.
This step is repeated until all of the bytes are sent and received.

4.     The Server sets up and performs the transaction with the information
provided.

5.     Upon completion of the transaction, the server sends back (up to)
the number of parameter and data bytes requested (or as many as will
fit in the negotiated buffer size).  This step is repeated until all
result bytes have been returned.

The flow for the transaction protocol when the request parameters and
data do not all fit in a single buffer is:

The primary transaction request through the final response make up the
complete transaction exchange, thus the Tid, Pid, Uid and Mid must remain
constant and can be used as appropriate by both the server and the
client.  Of course, other SMB requests may intervene as well.

There are (at least) three ways that actual server responses have been
observed to differ from what might be expected.  First, some servers will
send Pad bytes to move the DataOffset to a 2- or 4-byte boundary even if
there are no data bytes; the point here is that the ByteCount must be
used instead of ParameterOffset plus ParameterCount to infer the actual
message length.  Second, some servers always return MaxParameterCount
bytes even if the particular Transact2 has no parameter response.
Finally, in case of an error, some servers send the "traditional
WordCount==0/ByteCount==0" response while others generate a Transact
response format.

performance when interoperating with a server speaking the latest
dialect as of this writing ("NT LM 0.12").

Note that, as of this writing, no existing client restricts itself to
only these requests, so no useful server can be written that supports
just them. The classification is provided so that future clients will be

If the server is in "share level security mode", the account name and
passwd should be ignored by the server.

If challenge/response authentication is not being used, AccountPassword
should be a null terminated ASCII string with PasswordLength set to the
string size including the null; the password will case insensitive. If
challenge/response authentication is being used (see section 2.10), then
AccountPassword will be the response to the server's challenge, and
PasswordLength should be set to its length.

The server validates the name and password supplied and if valid, it
registers the user identifier on this session as representing the
specified AccountName.  The Uid  field in the SMB header will then be
used to validate access on subsequent SMB requests.  The SMB requests
where permission checks are required are those which refer to a
symbolically named resource such as SMB_COM_OPEN, SMB_COM_RENAME,
SMB_COM_DELETE, etc..  The value of the Uid is relative to a specific
client/server session so it is possible to have the same Uid value
represent two different users on two different sessions at the server.

Multiple session setup commands may be sent to register additional users
on this session.  If the server receives an additional
SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX, only the Uid, AccountName and
AccountPassword fields need contain valid values (the server MUST ignore
the other fields).

The client writes the name of its domain in PrimaryDomain if it knows
what the domain name is.  If the domain name is unknown, the client
either encodes it as a NULL string, or as a question mark.

If bit0 of Action is set, this informs the client that although the
server did not recognize the AccountName, it logged the user in as a
guest.  This is optional behavior by the server, and in any case one
would ordinarily expect guest privileges to limited.

Another function of the Session Set Up protocol is to inform the server
of the maximum values which will be utilized by this client.  Here
MaxBufferSize is the maximum message size which the client can receive.
Thus although the server may support 16k buffers (as returned in the
SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE response), if the client only has 4k buffers, the
value of MaxBufferSize here would be 4096.  The minimum allowable value
for MaxBufferSize is 1024.  The SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE response includes the
server buffer size supported.  Thus this is the maximum SMB message size
which the client can send to the server.  This size may be larger than
the size returned to the server from the client via the
SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_AND X protocol which is the maximum SMB message
size which the server may send to the client.  Thus if the server's
buffer size were 4k and the client's buffer size were only 2K,  the
client could send up to 4k (standard) write requests but must only
request up to 2k for (standard) read requests.

The field, MaxMpxCount informs the server of the maximum number of
requests which the client will have outstanding to the server
simultaneously (see sections 5.13 and 5.25).

The VcNumber field specifies whether the client wants this to be the
first VC or an additional VC.

The values for MaxBufferSize, MaxMpxCount, and VcNumber must be less
than or equal to the maximum values supported by the server as returned
in the SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE response.

If the server gets a SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX request with VcNumber of
0 and other VCs are still connected to that client, they will be aborted

thus freeing any resources held by the server.  This condition could
occur if the client was rebooted and reconnected to the server before
the transport level had informed the server of the previous VC
termination.

If the negotiated SMB dialect is "NT LM 0.12" or later, the format of
the response SMB is unchanged, but the request is:

The serving machine verifies the combination and returns an error code
or an identifier.  The full name is included in this request message and
the identifier identifying the connection is returned in the Tid field
of the SMB header.  The Tid field in the client request is ignored.  The
meaning of this identifier (Tid) is server specific; the client must not
associate any specific meaning to it.

If the negotiated dialect is LANMAN1.0 or later, then it is a protocol
violation for the client to send this message prior to a successful
SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX, and the server ignores Password.

If the negotiated dialect is prior to LANMAN1.0 and the client has not
sent a successful SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX request when the tree
connect arrives, a user level security mode server must nevertheless
validate the client's credentials as discussed earlier in this document.

Path follows UNC style syntax, that is to say it is encoded as
\\server\share and it indicates the name of the resource to which the
client wishes to connect.

Because Password may be an authentication response, it is a variable
length field with the length specified by PasswordLength.   If
authentication is not being used, Password should be a null terminated
ASCII string with PasswordLength set to the string size including the
terminating null.

The server can enforce whatever policy it desires to govern share
access. Typically, if the server is paused, administrative privilege is
required to connect to any share; if the server is not paused,
administrative privilege is required only for administrative shares (C$,
etc.). Other such policies may include valid times of day, software
usage license limits, number of simultaneous server users or share
users, etc.

The Service component indicates the type of resource the client intends
to access.  Valid values are:

<a name="s4.1.7">4.1.7</a>  ECHO: Ping the Server

This request is used to test the connection to the server, and to see if
the server is still responding.

 ================================== =================================

 UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 1
 USHORT EchoCount;                  Number of times to echo data back
 USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes;    min = 1

 UCHAR Buffer[1];                   Echoed data



Each response echoes the data sent, though ByteCount may indicate no
data  If EchoCount is zero, no response is sent.

Tid in the SMB header is ignored, so this request may be sent to the
server even if there are no valid tree connections to the server.

The flow for the ECHO protocol is:


 Client Request                     &lt;-&gt;  Server Response

 Echo Request (EchoCount == n)      -&gt;

The Sid, Uid, Pid, Tid, and Mid fields of the SMB are used to locate an
pending server request from this session.  If a pending request is
found, it is "hurried along" which may result in success or failure of
the original request.  No other response is generated for this SMB.

If no value is specified, it still allows an application to query
attributes without actually accessing the file.

The ExtFIleAttributes parameter specifies the file attributes and flags
for the file. The parameter's value is the sum of allowed attributes and
flags defined in section 3.11 on  Extended File Attribute Encoding

The ShareAccess field Specifies how this file can be shared. This
parameter must be some combination of the following values:


Name              Value      Meaning
                  0          Prevents the file from being shared.
FILE_SHARE_READ   0x00000001 Other open operations can be performed on
                              the file for read access.
FILE_SHARE_WRITE  0x00000002 Other open operations can be performed on
                              the file for write access.
FILE_SHARE_DELETE 0x00000004 Other open operations can be performed on
                              the file for delete access.


The CreateDisposition parameter can contain one of the following values:


CREATE_NEW        Creates a new file. The function fails if the
                  specified file already exists.
CREATE_ALWAYS     Creates a new file. The function overwrites the file
                  if it exists.
OPEN_EXISTING     Opens the file. The function fails if the file does
                  not exist.
OPEN_ALWAYS       Opens the file, if it exists. If the file does not
                  exist, act like CREATE_NEW.
TRUNCATE_EXISTING Opens the file. Once opened, the file is truncated so
                  that its size is zero bytes. The calling process must
                  open the file with at least GENERIC_WRITE access. The
                  function fails if the file does not exist.


The ImpersonationLevel parameter can contain one or more of the
following values:


SECURITY_ANONYMOUS        Specifies to impersonate the client at the
                          Anonymous impersonation level.
SECURITY_IDENTIFICATION   Specifies to impersonate the client at the
                          Identification impersonation level.
SECURITY_IMPERSONATION    Specifies to impersonate the client at the
                          Impersonation impersonation level.
SECURITY_DELEGATION       Specifies to impersonate the client at the
                          Delegation impersonation level.


The SecurityFlags parameter can have either of the following two flags
set:

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97



SECURITY_CONTEXT_TRACKING  Specifies that the security tracking mode is
                           dynamic. If this flag is not specified,
                           Security Tracking Mode is static.
SECURITY_EFFECTIVE_ONLY    Specifies that only the enabled aspects of
                           the client's security context are available
                           to the server. If you do not specify this
                           flag, all aspects of the client's security
                           context are available. This flag allows the
                           client to limit the groups and privileges
                           that a server can use while impersonating the
                           client.

Locking is a simple mechanism for excluding other processes read/write
access to regions of a file.  The locked regions can be anywhere in the
logical file.  Locking beyond end-of-file is permitted.  Any process
using the Fid specified in this request's Fid has access to the locked
bytes, other processes will be denied the locking of the same bytes.

The proper method for using locks is not to rely on being denied read or
write access on any of the read/write protocols but rather to attempt
the locking protocol and proceed with the read/write only if the locks
succeeded.

Locking a range of bytes will fail if any subranges or overlapping
ranges are locked.  In other words, if any of the specified bytes are
already locked, the lock will fail.

If NumberOfUnlocks is non-zero, the Unlocks vector contains
NumberOfUnlocks elements.  Each element requests that a lock at Offset
of Length be released.  If NumberOfLocks is nonzero, the Locks vector
contains NumberOfLocks elements.  Each element requests the acquisition
of a lock at Offset of Length.

Timeout is the maximum amount of time to wait for the byte range(s)
specified to become unlocked.  A timeout value of 0 indicates that the
server should fail immediately if any lock range specified is locked.  A

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


timeout value of -1 indicates that the server should wait as long as it
takes for each byte range specified to become unlocked so that it may be
again locked by this protocol.  Any other value of smb_timeout specifies
the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for all lock range(s)
specified to become available.

If any of the lock ranges timeout because of the area to be locked is
already locked (or the lock fails), the other ranges in the protocol
request which were successfully locked as a result of this protocol will
be unlocked (either all requested ranges will be locked when this
protocol returns to the client or none).

If LockType has the LOCKING_ANDX_SHARED_LOCK flag set, the lock is
specified as a shared lock.  Locks for both read and write (where
LOCKING_ANDX_SHARED_LOCK is clear) should be prohibited, but other
shared locks should be permitted.  If shared locks can not be supported
by a server, the server should map the lock to a lock for both read and
write.  Closing a file with locks still in force causes the locks to be
released in no defined order.

If LockType has the LOCKING_ANDX_LARGE_FILES flag set and if the
negotiated protocol is NT LM 0.12 or later, then the Locks and Unlocks
vectors are in the Large File LOCKING_ANDX_RANGE format.  This allows
specification of 64 bit offsets for very large files.

If the one and only member of the Locks vector has the
LOCKING_ANDX_CANCEL_LOCK flag set in the LockType field, the client is
requesting the server to cancel a previously requested, but not yet
responded to, lock.

If LockType has the LOCKING_ANDX_CHANGE_LOCKTYPE flag set, the client is
requesting that the server atomically change the lock type from a shared
lock to an exclusive lock or vice versa.  If the server can not do this
in an atomic fashion, the server must reject this request.  NT and W95
servers do not support this capability.

Oplocks are described in the "Opportunistic Locks" section elsewhere in
this document.  A client requests an oplock by setting the appropriate
bit in the SMB_COM_OPEN_ANDX request when the file is being opened in a
mode which is not exclusive.  The server responds by setting the
appropriate bit in the response SMB indicating whether or not the oplock
was granted.  By granting the oplock, the server tells the client the
file is currently only being used by this one client process at the
current time.  The client can therefore safely do read ahead and write
behind as well as local caching of file locks knowing that the file will
not be accessed/changed in any way by another process while the oplock
is in effect.  The client will be notified when any other process
attempts to open or modify the oplocked file.

When another user attempts to open or otherwise modify the file which a
client has oplocked, the server delays the second attempt and notifies
the client via an SMB_LOCKING_ANDX SMB asynchronously sent from the
server to the client.  This message has the LOCKING_ANDX_OPLOCK_RELEASE
flag set indicating to the client that the oplock is being broken.

OplockLevel indicates the type of oplock the client now owns. If
OplockLevel is 0, the client possesses no oplocks on the file at all, if
OplockLevel is 1 the client possesses a Level II oplock.  The client is
expected to flush any dirty buffers to the server, submit any file locks
and respond to the server with either an SMB_LOCKING_ANDX SMB having the
LOCKING_ANDX_OPLOCK_RELEASE flag set, or with a file close if the file
is no longer in use by the client.  If the client sends an
SMB_LOCKING_ANDX SMB with the LOCKING_ANDX_OPLOCK_RELEASE flag set and
NumberOfLocks is zero, the server does not send a response.  Since a
close being sent to the server and break oplock notification from the
server could cross on the wire, if the client gets an oplock
notification on a file which it does not have open, that notification
should be ignored.

Due to timing, the client could get an "oplock broken" notification in a
user's data buffer as a result of this notification crossing on the wire
with a SMB_COM_READ_RAW request.  The client must detect this (use
length of msg, "FFSMB", MID of -1 and Command of SMB_COM_LOCKING_ANDX)
and honor the "oplock broken" notification as usual.  The server must
also note on receipt of an SMB_COM_READ_RAW request that there is an
outstanding (unanswered) "oplock broken" notification to the client and
return a zero length response denoting failure of the read raw request.
The client should (after responding to the "oplock broken"
notification), use a standard read protocol to redo the read request.
This allows a file to actually contain data matching an "oplock broken"

                                    1 = from current position

USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes = 0



 The starting point of the seek is set by Mode:

     0  seek from start of file
     1  seek from current file pointer
     2  seek from end of file


The "current position" reflects the offset plus data length specified in
the previous read, write or seek request, and the pointer set by this
command will be replaced by the offset specified in the next read, write
or seek command.


Server Response                    Description
================================== =================================

 UCHAR WordCount;                  Count of parameter words = 2
 ULONG Offset;                     Offset from start of file
 USHORT ByteCount;                 Count of data bytes = 0



The response returns the new file pointer in Offset which is expressed
as the offset from the start of the file, and may be beyond the current
end of file.  An attempt to seek to before the start of file sets the
current file pointer to start of the file.

This request should generally only be issued by clients wishing to find
the size of a file, since all read and write requests include the read
or write file position as part of the SMB.  This request is
inappropriate for  very large files, as the offsets specified are only
32 bits.  A seek which results in an Offset which can not be expressed
in 32 bits returns the least significant.

since the server's operating system is generally scheduling disk writes
is a way which is optimal for the system's read and write activity
integrated over the entire population of clients.  This message from a
client "interferes" with the server's ability to optimally schedule the
disk activity; clients are discouraged from overuse of this SMB request.

it is the last character of the file.

If the destination is a file and the source contains wildcards, the
destination file will either be truncated or appended to at the start of
the operation depending on bits in OpenFunction (see section 3.7).
Subsequent files will then be appended to the file.

If the negotiated dialect is  LM1.2X002 or later, bit5 of Flags is used
to specify a tree copy on the remote server.  When this option is
selected the destination must not be an existing file and the source
mode must be binary.  A request with bit5 set and either bit0 or bit3
set is therefore an error.  When the tree copy mode is selected, the
Count field in the server response is undefined.

This SMB is used to verify that a path exists and is a directory.  No
error is returned if the given path exists and the client has read
access to it.  Client machines which maintain a concept of a "working
directory" will find this useful to verify the validity of a "change
working directory" command.  Note that the servers do NOT have a concept
of working directory for a particular client.  The client must always
supply full pathnames relative to the Tid in the SMB header.

This command notifies the client when the directory specified by Fid is
modified.  It also returns the name(s) of the file(s) that changed.  The
command completes once the directory has been modified based on the
supplied CompletionFilter.  The command is a "single shot" and therefore
needs to be reissued to watch for more directory changes.

A directory file must be opened before this command may be used.  Once
the directory is open, this command may be used to begin watching files
and subdirectories in the specified directory for changes.  The first
time the command is issued, the MaxParameterCount field in the transact
header determines the size of the buffer that will be used at the server
to buffer directory change information between issuances of the notify
change commands.

When a change that is in the CompletionFilter is made to the directory,
the command completes.  The names of the files that have changed since
the last time the command was issued are returned to the client.  The
ParameterCount field of the response indicates the number of bytes that

the command was issued, then zero bytes are returned and an alternate
status code is returned in the Status field of the response.

following flags:

The server response is a list of Referrals which inform the client where
it should resubmit the request to obtain access to the file.
PathConsumed in the response indicates to the client how many characters
of  RequestFilename have been consumed by the server.  When the client
chooses one of the referrals to use for file access, the client may need
to strip the leading PathConsumed characters from the front of
RequestFileName before submitting the name to the target server.
Whether or not the pathname should be trimmed is indicated by the
individual referral as detailed below.

Flags indicates how this referral should be treated.  If bit0 is clear,
any entity in the Referrals list holds the storage for RequestFileName.
If bit0 is set, any entity in the Referrals list has further referral
information for RequestFilename - a TRANS2_GET_DFS_REFERRAL request
should be sent to an entity in the Referrals list for further
resolution.

The format of an individual referral contains version and  length
information allowing the client to skip referrals it does not
understand.  MaxReferralLevel indicates to the server the latest version
of referral which the client can digest.  Since each referral has a
uniform element, MaxReferralLevel is advisory only. Each element in
Referrals has this envelope:

As part of the Distributed Name Resolution algorithm, a DFS client may
discover a  knowledge inconsistency between the referral server (i.e.,
the server that handed out a referral), and the storage server (i.e.,
the server to which the client was redirected to by the referral
server). When such an inconsistency is discovered, the DFS client
optionally sends this SMB to the referral server, allowing the referral
server to take corrective action.

The data part of this request contains the referral element (Version 1
format only) believed to be in error.  These are encoded as described in
the TRANS2_GET_DFS_REFERRAL response.  If the server returns success,
the client can resubmit the TRANS2_GET_DFS_REFERRAL request to this
server to get a new referral.  It is not mandatory for the DFS knowledge
to be automatically repaired - the client must be prepared to receive
further errant referrals and must not wind up looping between this
request and the TRANS2_GET_DFS_REFERRAL request.

Bit15 of Flags2 in the SMB header must be set, indicating this is a
UNICODE request.

<a name="s5.5">5.5</a>  LOCK_AND_READ: Lock and Read Bytes

This  request is used to lock and "read ahead" the specified bytes of

USHORT ByteCount;              Count of data bytes = 0



Fid must refer to a disk file.  Count specifies the requested number of
bytes.  Offset specifies the offset in the file of the first byte to be
locked then read.  Note that this offset is limited to 32 bits, so this
client request is inappropriate for files having 64 bit offsets.

Remaining is advisory.  If the value is not zero, then it is taken as an
estimate of the total number of bytes that will be read, including those
read by this request.  This additional information may be used by the
server to optimize buffer allocation or read-ahead.  Remaining is not
included in the byte range to be locked.

ByteCount is the number of bytes actually being returned. ByteCount may
be less than the count requested only if a read specifies bytes beyond

the current file size.  In this case only the bytes that exist are
returned.  A read completely beyond the end of file results in a
response of length zero.  This is the only circumstance when a zero
length response is generated.  A count returned which is less than the
count requested is the end of file indicator.

As in the core SMB_LOCK_BYTE_RANGE request,  if the lock can not be
immediately granted an error should be returned to the client.  If an
error occurs on the lock, the bytes should not be read.  If a Read
requests more data than can be placed in a message of the maximum-xmit-
size for the Tid specified, the server will abort the connection to the
client.


<a name="s5.6">5.6</a>  LOCK_BYTE_RANGE: Lock Bytes

The lock record message is sent to lock the given byte range.  More than
one non-overlapping byte range may be locked in a given file.  Locks
prevent attempts to lock, read or write the locked portion of the file
by other clients or Pids.  Overlapping locks are not allowed. Offsets
beyond the current end of file may be locked.  Such locks will not cause
allocation of file space.

Since Offset is a 32 bit quantity, this request is inappropriate for
general locking within a very large file.

   0  read-only
   1  write-only
   2 read/write

File Handles (Fids) are scoped per client.  A Pid may reference any Fid
established by itself or any other Pid on the client (so far as the
server is concerned).  The actual accesses allowed through the Fid
depends on the open and deny modes specified when the file was opened
(see below).

The MS-DOS compatibility mode of file open provides exclusion at the
client level.  A file open in compatibility mode may be opened (also in
compatibility mode) any number of times for any combination of reading
and writing (subject to the user's permissions) by any Pid on the same
client.  If the first client has the file open for writing, then the
file may not be opened in any way by any other client.  If the first
client has the file open only for reading, then other clients may open
the file, in compatibility mode, for reading..  The above
notwithstanding, if the filename has an extension of .EXE, .DLL, .SYM,
or .COM other clients are permitted to open the file regardless of
read/write open modes of other compatibility mode opens.  However, once
multiple clients have the file open for reading, no client is permitted
to open the file for writing and no other client may open the file in
any mode other than compatibility mode.

The other file exclusion modes (Deny read/write, Deny write, Deny read,
Deny none) provide exclusion at the file level.  A file opened in any
"Deny" mode may be opened again only for the accesses allowed by the
Deny mode (subject to the user's permissions).  This is true regardless
of the identity of the second opener -a different client, a Pid from the
same client, or the Pid that already has the file open.  For example, if
a file is open in "Deny write" mode a second open may only obtain read
permission to the file.

Although Fids are available to all Pids on a client, Pids other than the
owner may not have the full access rights specified in the open mode by
the Fid's creator.  If the open creating the Fid specified a deny mode,
then any Pid using the Fid, other than the creating Pid, will have only
those access rights determined by "anding" the open mode rights and the
deny mode rights, i.e., the deny mode is checked on all file accesses.
For example, if a file is opened for Read/Write in Deny write mode, then
other clients may only read the file and cannot write; if a file is
opened for Read in Deny read mode, then the other clients can neither
read nor write the file.

(see section 3.9 -  Open Action Encoding).

SearchAttributes indicates the attributes that the file must have to be
found while searching to see if it exists.  The encoding of this field
is described in the "File Attribute Encoding" section elsewhere in this
document.  If SearchAttributes is zero then only normal files are
returned.  If the system file, hidden or directory attributes are
specified then the search is inclusive -- both the specified type(s) of
files and normal files are returned.

FileType returns the kind of resource actually opened:

This SMB should not generate any errors from the server, unless the
server is a user mode server and Uid in the SMB header is invalid.

Clients are not required to send this SMB, they can do all cleanup
necessary by sending close SMBs to the server to release resources.  In
fact, clients who have negotiated LANMAN 1.0 and later probably do not
send this message at all.

ByteCount is the number of bytes actually being returned.  If Fid refers
to a disk file, ByteCount may be less than the count requested only if a
read specifies bytes beyond the current file size.  In this case only
the bytes that exist are returned.  A read completely beyond the end of
file results in a response of length zero.  This is the only
circumstance when a zero length response is generated.  A count returned
which is less than the count requested is the end of file indicator.

If a Read requests more data than can be placed in a message of the
maximum-xmit-size for the Tid specified, the server will abort the
connection to the client.

Other requests may be active between the client and server.  The server
responds with the one or more response messages as defined above until
the requested data amount has been returned.  Each response contains the
Pid and Mid of the original request and the Offset and Count of
describing the placement of the data within the file.

The client knows the maximum amount of data bytes which the server may
return (from MaxCount of the request).  Thus the client initializes its
bytes expected variable to this value.  The server then informs the
client of the actual amount being returned via each part of the response
in Count.  The server may reduce the expected bytes by lowering the
total number of bytes expected in Count in any response.

When the amount of data bytes received (sum of the DataLength fields)
equals the total amount of data bytes expected (smallest Count
received), then the client  has received all the data bytes.  This
allows the protocol to work even if the responses are received out of
sequence.

Note that DataLength being returned here can not be larger than the
smaller of the client's buffer size (as specified in MaxBufferSize on
the COM_SESSION_SETUP_AND_X client request SMB) or the server's buffer
size (as specified in MaxBufferSize of the COM_NEGOTIATE server response
SMB).

As is true in SMB_COM_READ, the total number of bytes returned may be
less than the number requested only if a read specifies bytes beyond the
current file size and Fid refers to a disk file.  In this case only the
bytes that exist are returned.  A read completely beyond the end of file
will result in a single response with a zero value in Count.  If the
total number of bytes returned is less than the number of bytes
requested, this indicates end of file (if reading other than a standard
blocked disk file, only ZERO bytes returned indicates end of file).

Once started, the Read Block Multiplexed operation is expected to go to
completion.  The client is expected to receive all the responses

generated by the server.  Conflicting commands (such as file close) must
not be sent to the server while a multiplexed operation is in progress.

The flow for the SMB_COM_READ_MPX protocol is:

client &lt;--------------&lt; Read MPX response 1 with data &lt;---------- server

<a name="s5.14">5.14</a>  READ_RAW: Read Raw

The SMB_COM_READ_RAW protocol is used to maximize the performance of
reading a large block of data from the server to the client.  This
request can be applied to files and named pipes.


Client Request                   Description
================================ ===================================

UCHAR WordCount;                 Count of parameter words = 8
USHORT Fid;                      File handle
ULONG Offset;                    Offset in file to begin read
USHORT MaxCount;                 Max bytes to return (maximum 65535)
USHORT MinCount;                 Min bytes to return (normally 0)
ULONG Timeout;                   Wait time if named pipe
USHORT Reserved;
USHORT ByteCount;                Count of data bytes = 0



Fid identifies the resource being read, and may refer to a disk file or
a named pipe.

Timeout is the number of milliseconds to wait for completion Fid refers
to a named pipe.

When the client issues this request, the client must guarantee that
there is (and will be) no other request to the server for the duration
of the SMB_COM_READ_RAW.  The server will respond, in one send, with the
raw data being read.  Thus the client is able to request up to 65,535
bytes of data and receive it directly into the user's buffer, since the
server response has no header or trailer.  Note that the amount of data
requested is expected to be larger than the negotiated buffer size for
this protocol.

The reason that no other requests can be active on the client's
connection to the server for the duration of the request is that if
other receives are present, there is normally no way to guarantee that
the data will be received into the user space, rather the data may fill
one (or more) of the other buffers.

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


The number of bytes actually returned is determined by the length of the
message the client receives as reported by the transport layer.  If the
request is to read more bytes than are present in the file, the read
response will be of the length actually read from the file.

If none of the requested bytes exist (EOF) or an error occurs on the
read, the server responds with a zero byte send.  Upon receipt of a zero
length response, the client should send a different type of request to
the server.  The response to that read will then tell the client that
EOF was hit or identify the error condition.

The number of bytes returned may be less than the number requested only
if a read specifies bytes beyond the current file size.  In this case
only the bytes that exist are returned.  A read completely beyond the
end of file results in a response of zero length.  If the number of
bytes returned is less than the number of bytes requested, this
indicates end of file (if reading other than a standard blocked disk
file, only ZERO bytes returned indicates end of file).

The transport layer guarantees delivery of all response bytes to the
client.  Thus no  SMB level confirmation protocol is required.  If an
error should occur at the clients end, all bytes must be received and
thrown away.  There is no need to inform the server of the error.

This message was introduced with the LANMAN1.0 SMB dialect.  Whether or
not this request is supported is returned in the response to
SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE.

The flow for reading a sequential file using SMB_COM_READ_BOCK_RAW is:


 Client Request                 Server Response
 ============================== =====================================

 SMB_COM_OPEN file              Success
 SMB_COM_READ_RAW
                                 raw data returned
 SMB_COM_READ_RAW
                                 more raw data returned
 SMB_COM_READ_RAW
                                 short (or 0 length) response returned
 SMB_COM_READ
                                 0 bytes returned indicating EOF
 SMB_COM_CLOSE                  Success



SMB_COM_READ_RAW has no way to return errors.  Because the response is
raw data only, a zero length response indicates EOF, a read error or
that the server is temporarily out of large buffers.  The client should
then retry using a different type of read request.  This request will
then either return the EOF condition, an error if the read is still
failing, or will work if the problem was due to a temporary server
condition.

If the negotiated dialect is NT LM 0.12 or later, and the response to
the SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE SMB has CAP_LARGE_FILES set in the Capabilities
field, a new format of  the SMB_COM_READ_RAW request is allowed which
accommodates very large files having 64 bit offsets.


 Client Request                   Description

This form of the request is differentiated from the previous form of the
request by the WordCount field.  In this case, the final offset to read
from is used by combining OffsetHigh and Offset, the resulting value can

FileName specifies the file to be sought.  SearchAttributes indicates
the attributes that the file must have, and is described in the "File
Attribute Encoding" section of this document.  If  SearchAttributes is
zero then only normal files are returned.  If the system file, hidden or
directory attributes are specified then the search is inclusive@both the
specified type(s) of files and normal files are returned.  If the volume
label attribute is specified then the search is exclusive, and only the
volume label entry is returned.

MaxCount specifies the number of directory entries to be returned.

The response will contain one or more directory entries as determined by
the Count field.  No more than MaxCount entries will be returned.  Only
entries that match the sought FileName and SearchAttributes combination
will be returned.

 ResumeKey must be null (length = 0) on the initial search request.
Subsequent search requests intended to continue a search must contain
the ResumeKey field extracted from the last directory entry of the
previous response.  ResumeKey is self-contained, for on calls containing
a non-zero ResumeKey neither the SearchAttributes or FileName fields
will be valid in the request.  ResumeKey has the following format:

FileName is 8.3 format, with the three character extension left
justified into FileName[9-11].  If the client is prior to the LANMAN1.0
dialect, the returned FileName should be uppercased.

SMB_COM_SEARCH terminates when either the requested maximum number of
entries that match the named file are found, or the end of directory is
reached without the maximum number of matches being found.  A response
containing no entries indicates that no matching entries were found
between the starting point of the search and the end of directory.

There may be multiple matching entries in response to a single request
as SMB_COM_SEARCH supports wildcards in the last component of FileName
of the initial request.

Returned directory entries in the DirectoryInformationData field of the

FileName must conform to 8.3 rules, and is padded after the extension
with 0x20 characters if necessary.  If the client has negotiated a
dialect prior to the LANMAN1.0 dialect, or if bit0 of the Flags2 SMB
header field of the request is clear, the returned FileName should be
uppercased.

As can be seen from the above structure, SMB_COM_SEARCH can not return
long filenames, and can not return UNICODE filenames.  Files which have
a size greater than 2^32 bytes should have the least significant 32 bits
of their size returned in FileSize.

The blocking/allocation units used in this response may be independent
of the actual physical or logical blocking/allocation algorithm(s) used
internally by the server.  However, they must accurately reflect the
amount of space on the server.

This SMB only returns 16 bits of information for each field, which may
not be large enough for some disk systems.  In particular TotalUnits is
commonly &gt; 64K.  Fortunately, it turns out the all the client cares
about is the total disk size, in bytes, and the free space, in bytes.
So,  it is reasonable for a server to adjust the relative values of
BlocksPerUnit and BlockSize to accommodate.  If after all adjustment,
the numbers are still too high, the largest possible values for
TotalUnit or FreeUnits (i.e. 0xFFFF) should be returned.

Count specifies the number of bytes to be written.  Offset is the offset
in the file of the first byte to be written.  Since offset is 32 bits,
this request is inappropriate for general use in a very large file.
Remaining is advisory:  if the value is not zero, then it is taken as an
estimate of the number of bytes that will be written -including those
written by this request.  This additional information may be used by the
server to optimize cache behavior.

When Fid represents a disk file and the request specifies a byte range
beyond the current end of file, the file will be extended.  Any bytes
between the previous end of file and the requested offset are
initialized to 0.  When a write specifies a length of zero, the file is
truncated (or extended) to the length specified by the offset.

Count in the response indicates the actual number of bytes written, and
for successful writes will always equal the count in the request
message.  If the number of bytes written differs from the number
requested and no error is indicated, then the server has no resources
available with which to satisfy the complete write.

If a Write sends a message of length greater than the MaxBufferSize for
the TID specified, the server may abort the connection to the client.

This request is used to first write the specified bytes and then unlock
them. The locked portion of a file is "safe" to write behind because no
other process can access the locked bytes until this process unlocks the
bytes.  Thus the client can buffer the locked bytes locally while they
are being updated, then when the unlock request is received submit this
protocol to both write and then unlock bytes.  Whether or not this SMB
is supported (along with SMB_COM_READ_AND_LOCK) is returned in bit0 of
the Flags field of the negotiate response.

Count specifies the number of bytes to be written.  Offset is the offset
in the file of the first byte to be written.  Since offset is 16 bits,
this request is inappropriate for general use in a very large file.
Remaining is advisory:  if the value is not zero, then it is taken as an
estimate of the number of bytes that will be written -including those
written by this request.  This additional information may be used by the
server to optimize cache behavior.  A value of 0 for Count is an error.

If the request specifies a byte range beyond the current end of file,
the file will be extended.  Any bytes between the previous end of file
and the requested offset are initialized to 0.

Count in the response indicates the actual number of bytes written, and
for successful writes will always equal the count in the request
message.  If the number of bytes written differs from the number
requested and no error is indicated, then the server has no resources
available with which to satisfy the complete write.

If a Write sends a message of length greater than the MaxBufferSize for
the TID specified, the server may abort the connection to the client. If
an error occurs on the write, the bytes remain locked.

Since clients can formulate the request in either of two ways, WordCount
must be used in order to correctly locate the data to be written.

Count specifies the number of bytes to be written.  Offset is the offset
in the file of the first byte to be written.  Since Offset is 32 bits,
this request is inappropriate for general use in a very large file.

If LastWriteTime and LastWriteDate are 0, the server should allow its
local operating system to set the file's times.  Otherwise, the server
should set the time to the values requested.  Failure to set the times,
even if requested by the client in this message, should not result in an
error response from the server.

If Count is 0, the file is truncated (or extended) to Offset.

If an error occurs on the write, the file should still be closed.

SMB_COM_WRITE_MPX is used to maximize the performance of writing a large
block of data from the client to the server.  The NT server supports
SMB_COM_WRITE_MPX only over connectionless transports, consequently bit7
of WriteMode in the request must be set.

Fid in the request must refer to either a file or a spooled printer.

Mask contains a bit mask indicating where in the transfer that the SMB
belongs.  The  response which contains the logical OR of all of the Mask
values received and is always generated.  All in this exchange use the
same SMB header Mid value but only final message is a connectionless
sequenced request (SequenceNumber is non-zero).

The server keeps a ResponseMask which is the logical or-ing of the
RequestMask value contained in each SMB_COM_WRITE_MPX received since the
last sequenced SMB_COM_WRITE_MPX.  The server only responds to the final
(sequenced) command, and this response contains the accumulated
ResponseMask. The client uses the ResponseMask received to determine
which packets, if any, must be retransmitted.  The server imposes no
restrictions on the values in the mask nor upon the order or contiguity
of the data being sent.  The client uses this behavior to only send the
missing parts in the next write sequence when retransmitting.  The next
SMB_COM_WRITE_MPX sequence sent must use a new SequenceNumber value or
the server will incorrectly respond with the mask from the previous
SMB_COM_WRITE_MPX command.

The flow is:


     Client             Sequence  &lt;-&gt;  Server

A server response will be generated only after the sequenced
SMB_COM_WRITE_MPX has been received unless this SMB is received over a
connection oriented transport (in which case the error response is
immediately sent).

At the time of the request, the client knows the number of data bytes
expected to be sent and passes this information to the server in Count.
The server can use this information to reserve buffer space, if
possible.

If bit0 of WriteMode is clear, the request assumed to be a form of write
behind on the part of the client.  If an error occurs while writing data
to disk such as disk full, the next access of the file handle (another
write, close, read, etc.) will return the fact that the error occurred.
If bit0 of WriteMode is set, the server will collect all the data, write
it to disk and then send a final response indicating the result of the
write .  The total number of bytes written is also returned in this
response.

The first response format will be that of the final server response in
the case where the server gets an error while writing the data sent
along with the request.  Thus Count is the number of bytes which did get
written any time an error is returned.  If an error occurs after the
first response has been sent allowing the client to send the remaining
data, the final response should not be sent unless write through is set.
Rather the server should return this "write behind" error on the next
access to the Fid.

The client must guarantee that there is (and will be) no other request
on the connection for the duration of this request.  The server will
reserve enough resources to receive the data and respond with a response
SMB as defined above.  The client then sends the raw data in one send.
Thus the server is able to receive up to 65,535 bytes of data directly
into the server buffer.  The amount of data transferred is expected to
be larger than the negotiated buffer size for this protocol.

The reason that no other requests can be active on the connection for
the duration of the request is that if other receives are present on the
connection, there is normally no way to guarantee that the data will be
received into the correct server buffer, rather the data may fill one
(or more) of the other buffers.  Also if the client is sending other
requests on the connection, a request may land in the buffer that the
server has allocated for the this SMB's data.

Whether or not SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW is supported is returned in the
response to SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE.  SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW is not supported for
connectionless clients.

When write through is not specified ((WriteMode &amp; 01) == 0) this SMB is
assumed to be a form of write behind.  The transport layer guarantees
delivery of all secondary requests from the client.  Thus no "got the
data you sent" SMB is needed.  If an error should occur at the server
end, all bytes must be received and thrown away.  If an error occurs
while writing data to disk such as disk full, the next access of the
file handle (another write, close, read, etc.) will return the fact that
the error occurred.

If write through is specified ((WriteMode &amp; 01) != 0), the server will
receive the data, write it to disk and then send a final response
indicating the result of the write.  The total number of bytes written
is also returned in this response in the Count field.

The flow for the SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW SMB is:

client -----&gt; SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW request (optional data) &gt;-------&gt; server
client &lt;------------------&lt; OK send (more) data &lt;---------------- server
client  ----------------------&gt; raw data &gt;----------------------&gt; server
client  &lt;---&lt; data on disk or error (write through only) &lt;------- server


This protocol is set up such that the SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW request may also
carry data.  This is an optimization in that up to the server's buffer
size (MaxCount from SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE response), minus the size of the
SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW SMB request, may be sent along with the request.  Thus
if the server is busy and unable to support the raw write of the
remaining data, the data sent along with the request has been delivered
and need not be sent again.  The server will write any data sent in the
request (and wait for it to be on the disk or device if write through is
set), prior to sending the response.

The specific responses error class ERRSRV, error codes ERRusempx and
ERRusestd, indicate that the server is temporarily out of the resources

needed to support the raw write of the remaining data, but that any data
sent along with the request has been successfully written.  The client
should then write the remaining data using a different type of SMB write
request, or delay and retry using SMB_COM_WRITE_RAW.  If a write error
occurs writing the initial data, it will be returned and the write raw
request is implicitly denied.

The return field Remaining is returned for named pipes only.  It is used
to return the number of bytes currently available in the pipe.  This
information can then be used by the client to know when a subsequent
(non blocking) read of the pipe may return some data.  Of course when
the read request is actually received by the server there may be more or
less actual data in the pipe (more data has been written to the pipe /
device or another reader drained it).  If the information is currently
not available or the request is NOT for a pipe or the server does not
support this feature, a -1 value should be returned.

If the negotiated dialect is NT LM 0.12 or later, and the response to
the SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE SMB has CAP_LARGE_FILES set in the Capabilities
field, an additional request format is allowed which accommodates very
large files having 64 bit offsets:

Dialect Name           Comment
====================== ========================================
=====

PC NETWORK PROGRAM 1.0 The original MSNET SMB protocol (otherwise
                        known as the "core protocol")
PCLAN1.0               Some versions of the original MSNET defined
                        this as an alternate to the core protocol
                        name
MICROSOFT NETWORKS     This is used for the MS-NET 1.03 product.  It
1.03                   defines Lock&amp;Read,Write&amp;Unlock, and a special
                        version of raw read and raw write.
MICROSOFT NETWORKS 3.0 This is the  DOS LANMAN 1.0 specific
                        protocol.  It is equivalent to the LANMAN 1.0
                        protocol, except the server is required to
                        map errors from the OS/2 error to an
                        appropriate DOS error.
LANMAN1.0              This is the first version of the full LANMAN
                        1.0 protocol
LM1.2X002              This is the first version of the full LANMAN
                        2.0 protocol
DOS LM1.2X002          This is the DOS equivalent of the LM1.2X002
                        protocol.  It is identical to the LM1.2X002
                        protocol, but the server will perform error
                        mapping to appropriate DOS errors.
DOS LANMAN2.1          DOS LANMAN2.1
LANMAN2.1              OS/2 LANMAN2.1
Windows for Workgroups Windows for Workgroups Version 1.0
3.1a
NT LM 0.12             The SMB protocol designed for NT networking.
                        This has special SMBs which duplicate the NT
                        semantics.



CIFS servers select the most recent version of the protocol known to
both client and server.  Any CIFS server which supports dialects newer
than the original core dialect must support all the messages and
semantics of the dialects between the core dialect and the newer one.
This is to say that a server which supports the NT LM 0.12 dialect must
also support all of the messages of the previous 10 dialects.  It is the
client's responsibility to ensure it only sends SMBs which are
appropriate to the dialect negotiated.  Clients must be prepared to
receive an SMB response from an earlier protocol dialect -- even if the
client used the most recent form of the request.


<a name="s7">7</a>  Error Codes and Classes

This section lists all of the valid values for
Status.DosError.ErrorClass, and most of the error codes for
Status.DosError.Error.

The following error classes may be returned by the server to the client.

<a name="s10">10</a>  Security Considerations

There are four authentication mechanisms, each with their own strengths
and weaknesses, as well as attacks that are independent of the
authentication protocol.


<a name="s10.1">10.1</a>  Share level protection

In share level protection, there are no per-user passwords; knowledge of
the read or write password is what gives read or write access. Since the
passwords must be disclosed to be used, and hence known by many people,
the scheme is quite weak.

In addition, the passwords are sent in the clear over the network, so
they have all the weaknesses of clear text passwords in user level
security.


<a name="s10.2">10.2</a>  Plaintext Password Authentication

This authentication protocol sends the client's password in the clear.
It should be used only when needed for backwards compatibility, and only
where the chances of eavesdropping is deemed acceptable, such as
relatively isolated networks. Passwords sent to such servers should
never be the same as passwords used for more secure servers.


<a name="s10.3">10.3</a>  LANMAN 2.1 (and earlier) Challenge/Response

This authentication protocol is subject to the following
vulnerabilities:

o Known plaintext attack

o Small key space

o Chosen plaintext attack

o Dictionary attack

o Badly chosen passwords

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


These attacks, if successful, compromise the client's password, and
allow the attacker access to the client's files even after the client's
session has ended. Because of these attacks, it should be used only when
needed for backwards compatibility, or where the chances of
eavesdropping are deemed acceptable, such as relatively isolated
networks. It is more secure than plaintext password authentication,
because passwords are never seen in the clear on the network. Whenever
possible, the use of the NT LM 0.12 authentication is to be preferred.


<a name="s10.3.1">10.3.1</a>  Known Plaintext Attacks

Because the challenge is plaintext, an eavesdropper can acquire known
plaintext/ciphertext pairs. It can then test a guess at a password by
using it to generate a key, encrypting the plaintext, and comparing it
to the corresponding ciphertext.


<a name="s10.3.2">10.3.2</a>  Small Key Space

The combination of the use of only uppercase characters, the usual user
practice of  choosing passwords that have alpha and perhaps numeric
characters, plus the fact that the protocol treats the upper and lower
halves of the 14 bytes key almost identically means that the key space
is rather small. Enumerating 7 uppercase characters and digits leads to
a key space of 36**7, or 78.3 billion combinations. When this mechanism
was introduced nearly a decade ago, this was probably an adequately
large key space, but with today's much more powerful systems, it is now
small enough to make a brute force search feasible upon a
plaintext/ciphertext pair obtained via a known plaintext attack.


<a name="s10.3.3">10.3.3</a>  Chosen Plaintext Attacks

A "main-in-the-middle" or a counterfeit server can choose the challenge
"C8" which the client will then encrypt using a key derived from the
client's password. The ability to choose the plaintext to be encrypted
is known to make breaking many ciphers much easier.


<a name="s10.3.4">10.3.4</a>  Dictionary Attacks

The attacker can precompute the response for many common passwords to a
challenge of its choice, and build a dictionary of (response, password)
pairs. It can then use the chosen plaintext attack to acquire a response
corresponding to that challenge, and just look up the password in the
dictionary.


<a name="s10.3.5">10.3.5</a>  Badly Chosen Passwords

Passwords that are not long enough, or that are words in the language of
the clients, make the above attacks even easier by reducing the key
space even more.

INTERNET-DRAFT            CIFS/1.0                  03/19/97


<a name="s10.4">10.4</a>  NT LM 0.12 Challenge/Response

Because it uses MD4 to generate the keying material from the password,
and because it preserves the password's case, the key space of this
protocol is essentially the full 56 bits that single DES allows; this is
probably an acceptable length for most purposes (although future
dialects may use triple-DES for more assurance). However, it is still
subject to the same chosen plaintext and dictionary attacks as LANMAN
2.1 challenge/response if passwords are badly chosen. The only cure is
to make sure that passwords are well-chosen, and long enough to have at
least 56 bits of randomness.

Other considerations:

o Transforming the password into Unicode leaves a pattern of
  alternating zeros and characters in the input to MD4.  This may allow
  MD4 to be reversed much more easily, although there is currently no
  known way to exploit this.

o MD4 is known to be weak with respect to collisions.  There may be a
  way to exploit this to attack its one-wayness, or to exploit the
  collision properties to limit key search time, although there is
  currently no known way to do so.


<a name="s10.5">10.5</a>  Other attacks




<a name="s10.5.1">10.5.1</a>  Hijack connections

Any attacker that can inject packets into the network that appear to the
server to be coming from a particular client, can hijack that client's
connection. Once a connection is set up and the client has
authenticated, subsequent packets are not authenticated, so the attacker
can inject requests to read, write, or delete files to which the client
has access. Doing so require that the injected packets have the right
transport level sequence numbers, which can be tricky, especially if the
client is sending packets at the same time. It is significantly more
difficult to hijack a connection than to eavesdrop, and doing so only
permits the attacker to access files as the client for the duration of
the session.


<a name="s10.5.2">10.5.2</a>  Downgrade attack

A "man-in-the-middle" can remove the bit in the SMB_COM_NEGPROT response
that says the server supports challenge/response, thus fooling a client
into thinking that it should supply a plaintext password. This attack
can be mitigated if clients are able to be configured to require
challenge/response, either in general or for particular servers.

<a name="s10.5.3">10.5.3</a>  Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers

A counterfeit server is one that spoofs the DNS name resolution process
so that the client gets the counterfeit's IP address instead of the
genuine server's IP address, thus fooling the client into connecting to
the counterfeit while believing it is connecting to the genuine server.
Counterfeit servers are not detectable by the challenge/response
authentication mechanism, which only authenticates clients. A
counterfeit server can use the downgrade attack above to obtain a
client's password; it can also execute a denial of service attack by
denying the client's requests or returning bogus results. Counterfeit
server attacks can be mitigated by deployment of DNSSEC.


<a name="s10.5.4">10.5.4</a>  Storing Passwords Safely

The passwords used in any of the authentication mechanisms used by this
protocol have to be protected from access from over the network and from
physical access. If the server does not support access control at the
individual file level, but only at the file tree level, then password
files can not be placed in a file tree that is accessible from the
network, as all files in such a tree have to be at least equally
readable.
